## Overview Description and Functional Form

```{r gumbelpdf, fig.cap="Probability density function for normal and Gumbel distributions."}
pdf <- tibble(
  x = seq(-5, 5, by = 0.01),
  Normal = dnorm(x, sd = sqrt(pi^2/6)),
  Gumbel = exp(-x) * exp(-exp(-x))
) 

ggplot(pdf %>% gather(key = "Distribution", value = "Probability", -x),
       aes(x = x, y = Probability, color = Distribution)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_bw()
```

```{r gumbelcdf, fig.cap = "Cumulative density function for normal and Gumbel distributions."}
cdf <- tibble(
  x = seq(-4, 5, by = 0.01),
  Normal = pnorm(x, sd = sqrt(pi^2 / 6)),
  Gumbel = exp(-exp(-x))
) 

ggplot(cdf %>% gather(key = "Distribution", value = "Probability", -x),
       aes(x = x, y = Probability, color = Distribution)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_bw()

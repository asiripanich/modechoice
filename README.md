This is a re-publication of [A Self-Instructing Course in Mode Choice Modeling](https://trid.trb.org/view/793000),
originally prepared by Frank Koppelman and Chandra Bhat for the Federal Transit
Administration.
The mathematics and instruction provided by this course have been extraordinarily
helpful to a generation of choice modelers and other transportation
professionals in academic and practical settings. 

The explosion of open-source
packages for logit modeling and literate programming more generally warrants
this re-publication in [bookdown]().

The R code to compute the choice models in this book is embedded within the
text and exposed to the viewer. In this way, the book serves not only as a
primer on choice modeling, but on how to estimate and interpret choice modelers
in R. This conversion project was undertaken by members of the AEP50(5) 
subcommittee on travel forecasting resources on behalf of the transportation
modeling community.

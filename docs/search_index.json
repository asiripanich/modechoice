Such models have numerous applications since many behavioral responses are discrete or qualitative in nature; that is, they correspond to choices of one or another of a set of alternatives. The ultimate interest in discrete choice modeling, as in most econometric modeling, lies in being able to predict the decision making behavior of a group of individuals (we will use the term “individual” and “decision maker” interchangeably, though the decision maker may be an individual, a household, a shipper, an organization, or some other decision making entity). A further interest is to determine the relative influence of different attributes of alternatives and characteristics of decision makers when they make choice decisions. For example, transportation analysts may be interested in predicting the fraction of commuters using each of several travel modes under a variety of service conditions, or marketing researchers may be interested in examining the fraction of car buyers selecting each of several makes and models with different prices and attributes. Further, they may be interested in predicting this fraction for different groups of individuals and identifying individuals who are most likely to favor one or another alternative. Similarly, they may be interested in understanding how different groups value different attributes of an alternative; for example are business air travelers more sensitive to total travel time or the frequency of flight departures for a chosen destination. There are two basic ways of modeling such aggregate (or group) behavior. One approach directly models the aggregate share of all or a segment of decision makers choosing each alternative as a function of the characteristics of the alternatives and socio-demographic attributes of the group. This approach is commonly referred to as the aggregate approach. The second approach is to recognize that aggregate behavior is the result of numerous individual decisions and to model individual choice responses as a function of the characteristics of the alternatives available to and socio-demographic attributes of each individual. This second approach is referred to as the disaggregate approach. The disaggregate approach has several important advantages over the aggregate approach to modeling the decision making behavior of a group of individuals. First, the disaggregate approach explains why an individual makes a particular choice given her/his circumstances and is, therefore, better able to reflect changes in choice behavior due to changes in individual characteristics and attributes of alternatives. The aggregate approach, on the other hand, rests primarily on statistical associations among relevant variables at a level other than that of the decision maker; as a result, it is unable to provide accurate and reliable estimates of the change in choice behavior due changes in service or in the population. Second, the disaggregate approach, because of its causal nature, is likely to be more transferable to a different point in time and to a different geographic context, a critical requirement for prediction. Third, discrete choice models are being increasingly used to understand behavior so that the behavior may be changed in a proactive manner through carefully designed strategies that modify the attributes of alternatives which are important to individual decision makers. The disaggregate approach is more suited for proactive policy analysis since it is causal, less tied to the estimation data and more likely to include a range of relevant policy variables. Fourth, the disaggregate approach is more efficient than the aggregate approach in terms of model reliability per unit cost of data collection. Disaggregate data provide substantial variation in the behavior of interest and in the determinants of that behavior, enabling the efficient estimation of model parameters. On the other hand, aggregation leads to considerable loss in variability, thus requiring much more data to obtain the same level of model precision. Finally, disaggregate models, if properly specified, will obtain un-biased parameter estimates, while aggregate model estimates are known to produce biased (i.e. incorrect) parameter estimates. 1.2 Use of Disaggregate Discrete Choice Models The behavioral nature of disaggregate models, and the associated advantages of such models over aggregate models, has led to the widespread use of disaggregate discrete choice methods in travel demand modeling. A few of these application contexts below with references to recent work in these areas are: travel mode choice (reviewed in detail later), destination choice (C. Bhat, Govindarajan, and Pulugurta 1998; Train 1998), route choice (Yai, Iwakura, and Morichi 1997; Cascetta et al. 2002; Erhardt et al. 2003; Gliebe and Koppelman 2002), air travel choices (Proussaloglou and Koppelman 1999), activity analysis (Wen and Koppelman 1999) and auto ownership, brand and model choice (Train and others 1994; C. R. Bhat and Pulugurta 1998). Choice models have also been applied in several other fields such as purchase incidence and brand choice in marketing (Kalyanam and Putler 1997; Bucklin, Gupta, and Han 1995), housing type and location choice in geography (Waddell 1993; Evers 1990; William Sermons and Koppelman 1998), choice of intercity air carrier (Proussaloglou and Koppelman 1999) and investment choices of finance firms (Corres, Hajivassiliou, and Ioannides 1993). 1.3 Application Context in Current Course In this self-instructing course, we focus on the travel mode choice decision. Within the travel demand modeling field, mode choice is arguably the single most important determinant of the number of vehicles on roadways. The use of high-occupancy vehicle modes (such as ridesharing arrangements and transit) leads to more efficient use of the roadway infrastructure, less traffic congestion, and lower mobile-source emissions as compared to the use of single-occupancy vehicles. Further, the mode choice decision is the most easily influenced travel decision for many trips. There is a vast literature on travel mode choice modeling which has provided a good understanding of factors which influence mode choice and the general range of trade-offs individuals are willing to make among level-of-service variables (such as travel time and travel cost). The emphasis on travel mode choice in this course is a result of its important policy implications, the extensive literature to guide its development, and the limited number of alternatives involved in this decision (typically, 3 – 7 alternatives). While the methods discussed here are equally applicable to cases with many alternatives, a limited number of mode choice alternatives enable us to focus the course on important concepts and issues in discrete choice modeling without being distracted by the mechanics and presentation complexity associated with larger choice sets. 1.4 Urban and Intercity Travel Mode Choice Modeling The mode choice decision has been examined both in the context of urban travel as well as intercity travel. 1.4.1 Urban Travel Mode Choice Modeling Many metropolitan areas are plagued by a continuing increase in traffic congestion resulting in motorist frustration, longer travel times, lost productivity, increased accidents and automobile insurance rates, more fuel consumption, increased freight transportation costs, and deterioration in air quality. Aware of these serious consequences of traffic congestion, metropolitan areas are examining and implementing transportation congestion management (TCM) policies. Urban travel mode choice models are used to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM policies in shifting single-occupancy vehicle users to high-occupancy vehicle modes. The focus of urban travel mode choice modeling has been on the home-based work trip. All major metropolitan planning organizations estimate home-based work travel mode choice models as part of their transportation planning process. Most of these models include only motorized modes, though increasingly non-motorized modes (walk and bike) are being included (Lawton 1989; Purvis 1997). The modeling of home-based non-work trips and non-home-based trips has received less attention in the urban travel mode choice literature. However, the increasing number of these trips and their contribution to traffic congestion has recently led to more extensive development of models for these trip purposes in some metropolitan regions (for example, Iglesias 1997; Marshall and Ballard 1998). In this course, we discuss model-building and specification issues for home-based work and home-based shop/other trips within an urban context, though the same concepts can be immediately extended to other trip purposes and locales. 1.4.2 Intercity Mode Choice Models Increasing congestion on intercity highways and at intercity air terminals has raised serious concerns about the adverse impacts of such congestion on regional economic development, national productivity and competitiveness, and environmental quality. To alleviate current and projected congestion, attention has been directed toward identifying and evaluating alternative proposals to improve intercity transportation services. These proposals include expanding or constructing new express roadways and airports, upgrading conventional rail services and providing new high-speed ground transportation services using advanced technologies. Among other things, the a priori evaluation of such large scale projects requires the estimation of reliable intercity mode choice models to predict ridership share on the proposed new or improved intercity service and identify the modes from which existing intercity travelers will be diverted to the new (or improved) service. Intercity travel mode choice models are usually segmented by purpose (business versus pleasure), day of travel (weekday versus weekend), party size (traveling individually versus group travel), etc. The travel modes in such models typically include car, rail, air, and bus modes (Koppelman and Wen 1998; C. R. Bhat 1998; and Marwick 1993). This manual examines issues of urban model choice; however, the vast majority of approaches and specifications can and have been used in intercity mode choice modeling. 1.5 Description of the Course This self-instructing course (SIC) is designed for readers who have some familiarity with transportation planning methods and background in travel model estimation. It updates and extends the previous SIC Manual (Horowitz, Koppelman, and Lerman 1986) in a number of important ways. First, it is more rigorous in the mathematical details reflecting increased awareness and application of discrete choice models over the past decade. The course is intended to enhance the understanding of model structure and estimation procedures more so than it is intended to introduce discrete choice modeling (readers with no background in discrete choice modeling may want to work first with the earlier SIC). Second, this SIC emphasizes “hands-on” estimation experience using data sets obtained from planning and decision-oriented surveys. Consequently, there is more emphasis on data structure and more extensive examination of model specification issues. Update: this manual uses the same models and data as the 2006 Bhat / Koppelman SIC, but the models are executed in R, with the data available for download and the estimation code exposed to the reader. Third, this SIC extends the range of travel modes to include non-motorized modes and discusses issues involved in including such modes in the analysis. Fourth, this SIC includes detailed coverage of the nested logit model which is being used more commonly in many metropolitan planning organizations today. 1.6 Organization of the Course Structure This course manual is divided into twelve chapters or modules. CHAPTER 1, this chapter, provides an introduction to the course. [CHAPTER 2][Elements of the Choice Decision Process] describes the elements of the choice process including the decision maker, the alternatives, the attributes of the alternative, and the decision rule(s) adopted by the decision maker in making his/her choice. [CHAPTER 3][Utility-based Choice Theory] introduces the basic concepts of utility theory followed by a discussion of probabilistic and deterministic choice concepts and the technical components of the utility function. [CHAPTER 4][The Multinomial Logit Model] describes the Multinomial Logit (MNL) Model in detail. The discussion includes the functional form of the model, its mathematical properties, and the practical implications of these properties in model development and application. The chapter concludes with an overview of methods used for estimating the model parameters. In [CHAPTER 5][Data Assembly and Estimation of Simple Multinomial Logit Models], we first discuss the data requirements for developing disaggregate mode choice models, the potential sources for these data, and the format in which these data need to be organized for estimation. Next, the data sets used in this manual, i.e., the San Francisco Bay Area 1990 work trip mode choice (for urban area journey to work travel) and the San Francisco Bay Area Shop/Other 1990 mode choice data (for non-work travel), are described. This is followed by the development of a basic work mode choice model specification. The estimation results of this model specification are reviewed with a comprehensive discussion of informal and formal tests to evaluate the appropriateness of model parameters and the overall goodness-of-fit statistics of the model. [CHAPTER 6][Model Specification Refinement] describes and demonstrates the process by which the utility function specification for the work mode choice model can be refined using intuition, statistical analysis, testing, and judgment. Many specifications of the utility function are explored for both data sets to demonstrate some of the most common specification forms and testing methods. Starting from a base model, incremental changes are made to the modal utility functions with the objective of finding a model specification that performs better statistically, and is consistent with theory and our a priori expectations about mode choice behavior. The appropriateness of each specification change is evaluated using judgment and statistical tests. This process leads to a preferred specification for the work mode choice MNL model. [CHAPTER 7][San Francisco Bay Area Shop / Other Mode Choice] parallels [CHAPTER 6][Model Specification Refinement] for the shop/other mode choice model. [CHAPTER 8][Nested Logit Model] introduces the Nested Logit (NL) Model. The Chapter begins with the motivation for the NL model to address one of the major limitations of the MNL. The functional form and the mathematical properties of the NL are discussed in detail. This is followed by a presentation of estimation results for a number of NL model structures for the work and shop/other data sets. Based on these estimation results, statistical tests are used to compare the various NL model structures with the corresponding MNL. [CHAPTER 9][Selecting a Preferred Nesting Structure] describes the issues involved in formulating, estimating and selecting a preferred NL model. The results of statistical tests are used in conjunction with our a priori understanding of the competitive structure among different alternatives to select a final preferred nesting structure. The practical implications of choosing this preferred nesting structure in comparison to the MNL model are discussed. [CHAPTER 11][Aggregate Forecasting Assessment, and Application] describes how models estimated from disaggregate data can be used to predict a aggregate mode choice for a group of individuals from relevant information regarding the altered value (due to socio-demographic changes or policy actions) of exogenous variables. The chapter also discusses issues related to the aggregate assessment of the performance of mode choice models and the application of the models to evaluate policy actions. [CHAPTER 12][Recent Advances in Discrete Choice Modeling] provides an overview of the motivation for and structure of advanced discrete choice models. The discussion is intended to familiarize readers with a variety of models that allow increased flexibility in the representation of the choice behavior than those allowed by the multinomial logit and nested logit models. It does not provide the detailed mathematical formulations or the estimation techniques for these advanced models. Appropriate references are provided for readers interested in this information.

However, we generally do not have information about the process individuals use to arrive at their observed choice. A proposed framework for the choice process is that an individual first determines the available alternatives; next, evaluates the attributes of each alternative relevant to the choice under consideration; and then, uses a decision rule to select an alternative from among the available alternatives (Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985), Chapter 3). Some individuals might select a particular alternative without going through the structured process presented above. For example, an individual might decide to buy a car of the same make and model as a friend because the friend is happy with the car or is a car expert. Or an individual might purchase the same brand of ice cream out of habit. However, even in these cases, one can view the behavior within the framework of a structured decision process by assuming that the individual generates only one alternative for consideration (which is also the one chosen). In the subsequent sections, we discuss four elements associated with the choice process; the decision maker, the alternatives, the attributes of alternatives and the decision rule. 2.2 The Decision Maker The decision maker in each choice situation is the individual, group or institution which has the responsibility to make the decision at hand. The decision maker will depend on the specific choice situation. For example, the decision maker will be the individual in college choice, career choice, travel mode choice, etc.; the household in residential location choice, vacation destination choice, number of cars owned, etc.; the firm in office or warehouse location, carrier choice, employee hiring, etc. or the State (in the selection of roadway alignments). A common characteristic in the study of choice is that different decision makers face different choice situations and can have different tastes (that is, they value attributes differently). For example, in travel mode choice modeling, two individuals with different income levels and different residential locations are likely to have different sets of modes to choose from and may place different importance weights on travel time, travel cost and other attributes. These differences among decision makers should be explicitly considered in choice modeling; consequently, it is important to develop choice models at the level of the decision maker and to include variables which represent differences among the decision makers. 2.3 The Alternatives Individuals make a choice from a set of alternatives available to them. The set of available alternatives may be constrained by the environment. For example, high speed rail between two cities is an alternative only if the two cities are connected by high speed rail. The choice set determined by the environment is referred to as the universal choice set. However, even if an alternative is present in the universal choice set, it may not be feasible for a particular individual. Feasibility of an alternative for an individual in the context of travel mode choice may be determined by legal regulations (a person cannot drive alone until the age of 16), economic constraints (limousine service is not feasible for some people) or characteristics of the individual (no car available or a handicap that prevents one from driving). The subset of the universal choice set that is feasible for an individual is defined as the feasible choice set for that individual. Finally, not all alternatives in the feasible choice set may be considered by an individual in her/his choice process. For example, transit might be a feasible travel mode for an individual’s work trip, but the individual might not be aware of the availability or schedule of the transit service. The subset of the feasible choice set that an individual actually considers is referred to as the consideration choice set. This is the choice set which should be considered when modeling choice decisions. The choice set may also be determined by the decision context of the individual or the focus of the policy makers supporting the study. For example, a study of university choice may focus on choice of school type (private vs. public, small vs. large, urban vs. suburban or rural location, etc.), if the perspective is national, or a choice of specific schools, if the perspective is regional. 2.4 Attributes of Alternatives The alternatives in a choice process are characterized by a set of attribute values. Following Lancaster (1971), one can postulate that the attractiveness of an alternative is determined by the value of its attributes. The measure of uncertainty about an attribute can also be included as part of the attribute vector in addition to the attribute itself. For example, if travel time by transit is not fixed, the expected value of transit travel time and a measure of uncertainty of the transit travel time can both be included as attributes of transit. The attributes of alternatives may be generic (that is, they apply to all alternatives equally) or alternative-specific (they apply to one or a subset of alternatives). In the travel mode choice context, in-vehicle-time is usually considered to be specific to all motorized modes because it is relevant to motorized alternatives. However, if travel time by bus is considered to be very onerous due to over-crowding, bus in-vehicle-time may be defined as a distinct variable with a distinct parameter; differences between this parameter and the in-vehicle-time parameter for other motorized modes will measure the degree to which bus time is considered onerous to the traveler relative to other in-vehicle time. Other times, such as wait time at a transit stop or transfer time at a transit transfer point are relevant only to the transit modes, not for the nontransit modes. It is also common to consider the travel times for non-motorized modes (bike and walk) as specific to only these alternatives. An important reason for developing discrete choice models is to evaluate the effect of policy actions. To provide this capability, it is important to identify and include attributes whose values may be changed through pro-active policy decisions. In a travel mode choice context, these variables include measures of service (travel time, frequency, reliability of service, etc.) and travel cost. 2.5 The Decision Rule An individual invokes a decision rule (i.e., a mechanism to process information and evaluate alternatives) to select an alternative from a choice set with two or more alternatives. This decision rule may include random choice, variety seeking, or other processes which we refer to as being irrational. As indicated earlier, some individuals might use other decision rules such as “follow the leader” or habit in choosing alternatives which may also be considered to be irrational. However, even in this case, rational discrete choice models may be effective if the decision maker who adopts habitual behavior previously evaluated different alternatives and selected the best one for him/her and there have been no intervening changes in her/his alternatives and preferences. However, in the case of follow-the-leader behavior, the decision maker is considered to be rational if the “leader” is believed to share a similar value system. An individual is said to use a rational decision process if the process satisfies two fundamental constructs: consistency and transitivity. Consistency implies the same choice selection in repeated choices under identical circumstances. Transitivity implies an unique ordering of alternatives on a preference scale. Therefore, if alternative A is preferred to alternative B and alternative B is preferred to alternative C, then alternative A is preferred to alternative C. A number of possible rules fall under the purview of rational decision processes (Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985), Chapter 3). In this course, the focus will be on one such decision rule referred to as utility maximization. The utility maximization rule is based on two fundamental concepts. The first is that the attribute vector characterizing each alternative can be reduced to a scalar utility value for that alternative. This concept implies a compensatory decision process; that is, it presumes that individuals make “trade-offs” among the attributes characterizing alternatives in determining their choice. Thus, an individual may choose a costlier travel mode if the travel time reduction offered by that mode compensates for the increased cost. The second concept is that the individual selects the alternative with the highest utility value. The focus on utility maximization in this course is based on its strong theoretical background, extensive use in the development of human decision making concepts, and amenability to statistical testing of the effects of attributes on choice. The utility maximization rule is also robust; that is, it provides a good description of the choice behavior even in cases where individuals use somewhat different decision rules. In the next chapter, we discuss the concepts and underlying principles of utility based choice theory in more detail. References "],

Generally, we think about utility as being derived from the attributes of alternatives or sets of alternatives; e.g., the total set of groceries purchased in a week. The utility maximization rule states that an individual will select the alternative from his/her set of available alternatives that maximizes his or her utility. Further, the rule implies that there is a function containing attributes of alternatives and characteristics of individuals that describes an individual’s utility valuation for each alternative. The utility function, \\(U\\), has the property that an alternative is chosen if its utility is greater than the utility of all other alternatives in the individual’s choice set. Alternatively, this can be stated as alternative, \\(&#39;i&#39;\\), is chosen among a set of alternatives, if and only if the utility of alternative, \\(&#39;i&#39;\\), is greater than or equal to the utility of all alternatives , \\(&#39;j&#39;\\), in the choice set, \\(C\\). This can be expressed mathematically as: \\[\\begin{equation} U(X_i,S_t) \\geq U(X_j,S_t) \\forall j \\Rightarrow i \\succ j \\forall j \\in C \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(U(~~~)\\) is the mathematical utility function, \\(X_i,X_j\\) are vectors of attributes describing alternatives i and j, respectively (e.g., travel time, travel cost, and other relevant attributes of the available modes), \\(S_t\\) is a vector of characteristics describing individual \\(t\\), that influence his/her preferences among alternatives (e.g., household income and number of automobiles owned for travel mode choice), \\(i \\succ j\\) means the alternative to the left is preferred to the alternative to the right, and \\(\\forall j\\) means all the cases, j, in the choice set. That is, if the utility of alternative \\(i\\) is greater than or equal to the utility of all alternatives, \\(j\\); alternative \\(i\\) will be preferred and chosen from the set of alternatives, \\(C\\). The underlying concept of utility allows us to rank a series of alternatives and identify the single alternative that has highest utility. The primary implication of this ranking or ordering of alternatives is that there is no absolute reference or zero point, for utility values. Thus, the only valuation that is important is the difference in utility between pairs of alternatives; particularly whether that difference is positive or negative. Any function that produces the same preference orderings can serve as a utility function and will give the same predictions of choice, regardless of the numerical values of the utilities assigned to individual alternatives. It also follows that utility functions, which result in the same order among alternatives, are equivalent. 3.2 Deterministic Choice Concepts The utility maximization rule, which states that an individual chooses the alternative with the highest utility, implies no uncertainty in the individual’s decision process; that is, the individual is certain to choose the highest ranked alternative under the observed choice conditions. Utility models that yield certain predictions of choice are called deterministic utility models. The application of deterministic utility to the case of a decision between two alternatives is illustrated in Figure 3.1 that portrays a utility space in which the utilities of alternatives 1 and 2 are plotted along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively, for each individual. The 45° line represents those points for which the utilities of the two alternatives are equal. Individuals B, C and D (above the equal-utility line) have higher utility for alternative 2 than for alternative 1 and are certain to choose alternative 2. Similarly, individuals A, E, and F (below the line) have higher utility for alternative 1 and are certain to choose that alternative. If deterministic utility models described behavior correctly, we would expect that an individual would make the same choice over time and that similar individuals (individuals having the same individual and household characteristics), would make the same choices when faced with the same set of alternatives. In practice, however, we observe variations in an individual’s choice and different choices among apparently similar individuals when faced with similar or even identical alternatives. For example, in studies of work trip mode choice, it is commonly observed that individuals, who are represented as having identical personal characteristics and who face the same sets of travel alternatives, choose different modes of travel to work. Further, some of these individuals vary their choices from day to day for no observable reason resulting in observed choices which appear to contradict the utility evaluations; that is, person A may choose Alternative 2 even though \\(U_1 &gt; U_2\\) or person C may choose Alternative 2 even though \\(U_2 &gt; U_1\\) . These observations raise questions about the appropriateness of deterministic utility models for modeling travel or other human behavior. The challenge is to develop a model structure that provides a reasonable representation of these unexplained variations in travel behavior. tibble(U1 = c(2.5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6), U2 = c(1, 4, 5, 7, 4, 5), label = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = U1, y = U2, label = label)) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Utility for Alternative 1&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Utility for Alternative 2&quot;) + geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, lty = &quot;dotted&quot;) + geom_label() + geom_text(data = tibble(U1 = c(2,5), U2 = c(6.5, 1.5), label= c(&quot;Alt. 2 Preferred&quot;, &quot;Alt. 1 Preferred&quot;))) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,8)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,8)) Figure 3.1: Illustration of Deterministic Choice There are three primary sources of error in the use of deterministic utility functions. First, the individual may have incomplete or incorrect information or misperceptions about the attributes of some or all of the alternatives. As a result, different individuals, each with different information or perceptions about the same alternatives are likely to make different choices. Second, the analyst or observer has different or incomplete information about the same attributes relative to the individuals and an inadequate understanding of the function the individual uses to evaluate the utility of each alternative. For example, the analyst may not have good measures of the reliability of a particular transit service, the likelihood of getting a seat at a particular time of day or the likelihood of finding a parking space at a suburban rail station. However, the traveler, especially if he/she is a regular user, is likely to know these things or to have opinions about them. Third, the analyst is unlikely to know, or account for, specific circumstances of the individual’s travel decision. For example, an individual’s choice of mode for the work trip may depend on whether there are family visitors or that another family member has a special travel need on a particular day. Using models which do not account for and incorporate this lack of information results in the apparent behavioral inconsistencies described above. While human behavior may be argued to be inconsistent, it can also be argued that the inconsistency is only apparent and can be attributed to the analyst’s lack of knowledge regarding the individual’s decision making process. Models that take account of this lack of information on the part of the analyst are called random utility or probabilistic choice models. 3.3 Probabilistic Choice Theory If analysts thoroughly understood all aspects of the internal decision making process of choosers as well as their perception of alternatives, they would be able to describe that process and predict mode choice using deterministic utility models. Experience has shown, however, that analysts do not have such knowledge; they do not fully understand the decision process of each individual or their perceptions of alternatives and they have no realistic possibility of obtaining this information. Therefore, mode choice models should take a form that recognizes and accommodates the analyst’s lack of information and understanding. The data and models used by analysts describe preferences and choice in terms of probabilities of choosing each alternative rather than predicting that an individual will choose a particular mode with certainty. Effectively, these probabilities reflect the population probabilities that people with the given set of characteristics and facing the same set of alternatives choose each of the alternatives. As with deterministic choice theory, the individual is assumed to choose an alternative if its utility is greater than that of any other alternative. The probability prediction of the analyst results from differences between the estimated utility values and the utility values used by the traveler. We represent this difference by decomposing the utility of the alternative, from the perspective of the decision maker, into two components. One component of the utility function represents the portion of the utility observed by the analyst, often called the deterministic (or observable) portion of the utility. The other component is the difference between the unknown utility used by the individual and the utility estimated by the analyst. Since the utility used by the decision maker is unknown, we represent this difference as a random error. Formally, we represent this by: \\[\\begin{equation} U_{it} = V_{it} + \\epsilon_{it} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(U_{it}\\) is the true utility of the alternative \\(i\\) to the decision maker \\(t\\), (\\(U_{it}\\) is equivalent to \\(U(X_i,S_t)\\) but provides a simpler notation), \\(V_{it}\\) is the deterministic or observable portion of the utility estimated by the analyst, and \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) is the error or the portion of the utility unkown to the analyst. The analyst does not have any information about the error term. However, the total error which is the sum of errors from many sources (imperfect information, measurement errors, omission of modal attributes, omission of the characteristics of the individual that influence his/her choice decision and/or errors in the utility function) is represented by a random variable. Different assumptions about the distribution of the random variables associated with the utility of each alternative result in different representations of the model used to describe and predict choice probabilities. The assumptions used in the development of logit type models are discussed in the next Chapter. 3.4 Components of the Deterministic Portion of the Utility Function The deterministic or observable portion (often called the systematic portion) of the utility of an alternative is a mathematical function of the attributes of the alternative and the characteristics of the decision maker. The systematic portion of utility can have any mathematical form but the function is most generally formulated as additive to simplify the estimation process. This function includes unknown parameters which are estimated in the modeling process. The systematic portion of the utility function can be broken into components that are (1) exclusively related to the attributes of alternatives, (2) exclusively related to the characteristics of the decision maker and (3) represent interactions between the attributes of alternatives and the characteristics of the decision maker. Thus, the systematic portion of utility can be represented by: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{t,i} = V(S_t) + V(X_i) + V(S_t,X_i) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(V_{it}\\) is the systematic portion of utility of alternative i for inidivual t, \\(V(S_t)\\) is the portion of utility associated with characteristics of individual \\(t\\), \\(V(X_i)\\) is the portion of utility of alternative \\(i\\) associated with the attributes of alternative \\(i\\), and \\(V(S_t,X_i)\\) is the portion of the utility which results from interactions between the attributes of alternative \\(i\\) and the characteristics of individual \\(t\\). Each of these utility components is discussed separately 3.4.1 Utility Associated with the Attributes of Alternatives The utility component associated exclusively with alternatives includes variables that describe the attributes of alternatives. These attributes influence the utility of each alternative for all people in the population of interest. The attributes considered for inclusion in this component are service attributes which are measurable and which are expected to influence people’s preferences/choices among alternatives. These include measures of travel time, travel cost, walk access distance, transfers required, crowding, seat availability, and others. For example: * Total travel time, * In-vehicle travel time, * Out-of-vehicle travel time, * Travel cost, * Number of transfers (transit modes), * Walk distance and, * Reliability of on time arrival. These measures differ across alternatives for the same individual and also among individuals due to differences in the origin and destination locations of each person’s travel. For example, this portion of the utility function could look like: \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_i) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ X_{i1} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ X_{i2} + L + \\gamma_k ~ &#39; ~ X_{ik} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\gamma_k\\) is the parameter which defines the direction and importance of the effect of attribute \\(k\\) on the utility of an alternative and \\(X_{ik}\\) is the value of attribute \\(k\\) for alternative \\(i\\). Thus, this portion of the utility of each alternative, \\(i\\), is the weighted sum of the attributes of alternative \\(i\\). A specific example for the Drive Alone (DA), Shared Ride (SR), and Transit (TR) alternatives is: \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{DA}) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ TT_{DA} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ TC_{DA} \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{SR}) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ TT_{SR} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ TC_{SR} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{TR}) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ TT_{TR} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ TC_{TR} + \\gamma_3 ~ &#39; ~ FREQ_{TR} \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(TT_i\\) is the travel time for mode \\(i\\) (\\(i\\) = \\(DA, SR, TR\\)) and \\(TC_i\\) is the travel cost for mode \\(i\\), and \\(FREQ_{TR}\\) is the frequency for transit services. Travel time and travel cost are generic; that is, they apply to all alternatives; frequency is specific to transit only. The parameters, \\(\\gamma_k\\), are identical for all the alternatives to which they apply. This implies that the utility value of travel time and travel cost are identical across alternatives. The possibility that travel time may be more onerous on Transit than by Drive Alone or Shared Ride could be tested by reformulating the above models to: \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{DA}) = \\gamma_{11} \\times TT_{DA} + \\gamma_{12} \\times 0 + \\gamma_2 \\times TC_{DA} \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{SR}) = \\gamma_{11} \\times TT_{SR} + \\gamma_{12} \\times 0 + \\gamma_2 \\times TC_{SR} \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{TR}) = \\gamma_{11} \\times 0 + \\gamma_{12} \\times TT_{TR} + \\gamma_2 \\times TC_{TR} + \\gamma_3 \\times FREQ_{TR} \\tag{3.10} \\end{equation}\\] That is, two distinct parameters would be estimated for travel time; one for travel time by DA and SR, \\(\\gamma_{11}\\), and the other for travel time by TR, \\(\\gamma_{12}\\). These parameters could be compared to determine if the differences are statistically significant or large enough to be important. 3.4.2 Utility ‘Biases’ Due to Excluded Variables It has been widely observed that decision makers exhibit preferences for alternatives which cannot be explained by the observed attributes of those alternatives. These preferences are described as alternative specific preference or bias; they measure the average preference of individuals with different characteristics for an alternative relative to a ‘reference’ alternative. As will be shown in CHAPTER 4, the selection of the reference alternative does not influence the interpretation of the model estimation results. In the simplest case, we assume that the bias is the same for all decision makers. In this case, this portion of the utility function would be: \\[\\begin{equation} Bias_i = \\beta_{i0} \\times ASC_i \\tag{3.11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{i0}\\) represents an increase in the utility of alternative \\(i\\) for all choosers and \\(ASC_i\\) is equal to one for alternative \\(i\\) and zero for all other alternatives. More detailed observation generally indicates that people with different personal and family characteristics have different preferences among sets of alternatives. For example, members of high income households are less likely to choose transit alternatives than low income individuals, all other things being equal. Similarly, members of households with fewer automobiles than workers are more likely to choose transit alternatives. Thus, it is useful to consider that the bias may differ across individuals as discussed in the next section. 3.4.3 Utility Related to the Characteristics of the Decision Maker The differences in ‘bias’ across individuals can be represented by incorporating personal and household variables in mode choice models. Variables commonly used for this purpose include: * Income of the traveler’s household, * Sex of traveler, * Age of traveler, * Number of automobiles in traveler’s household, * Number of workers in the traveler’s household, and * Number of adults in the traveler’s household. In some cases, these variables are combined. For example, the number of automobiles may be divided by the number of workers to indicate the availability of automobiles to each household member. This approach results in modification of the bias portion of the utility function to look like: \\[\\begin{equation} \\beta_{i0} \\times ASC_i + \\beta_{i1} \\times S_{1t} + \\beta_{i2} \\times S_{2t} + ... + \\beta_{iM} \\times S_{Mt} \\tag{3.12} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{im}\\) is the parameter which defines the direction and magnitude of the incremental bias due to an increase in the \\(m^{th}\\) characteristic of the decision maker (\\(m = 0\\) represents the parameter associated with the alternative specific constant) and \\(S_{mt}\\) is the value of the \\(m^{th}\\) characteristics for individual \\(t\\). For the case of three alternatives, (Drive Alone, Shared Ride and Transit), the decision maker components of the utility functions are: \\[\\begin{equation} V(S_{DA})=\\beta_{DA,0}\\times1+\\beta_{DA,1}\\times Inc_{t}+\\beta_{DA,2}\\times NCar_{t} \\tag{3.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(S_{SR})=\\beta_{SR,0}\\times1+\\beta_{SR,1}\\times Inc_{t}+\\beta_{SR,2}\\times NCar_{t} \\tag{3.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(S_{TR})=\\beta_{SR,0}\\times1+\\beta_{TR,1}\\times Inc_{t}+\\beta_{TR,2}\\times NCar_{t} \\tag{3.15} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{i0}\\) is the modal bias constant for mode \\(i\\) (\\(i\\)=DA,SR,TR), \\(Inc_{t}\\) is the household income of the traveler, \\(NCar_{t}\\) is the number of cars in the traveler’s household, and \\(\\beta_{i1}\\),\\(\\beta_{i2}\\) are mode specific parameters on income and cars, respectively, for mode \\(i\\) (\\(i\\)=DA,SR,TR) It is important to recognize that the parameters that describe the effect of traveler characteristics differ across alternatives while the variables are identical across alternatives for each individual. 3.4.4 Utility Defined by Interactions between Alternative Attributes and Decision Maker Characteristics The final component of utility takes into account differences in how attributes are evaluated by different decision makers. One effect of income, described earlier, is to increase the preference for travel by private automobile. This representation implies that the preference for DA and SR increase with income, independent of the attributes of travel by each alternative. Another way to represent the influence of income is that increasing income reduces the importance of monetary cost in the evaluation of modal alternatives. The idea that high income travelers place less importance on cost can be represented by dividing the cost of travel of an alternative by annual income or some function of annual income of the traveler or his/her household. Another interaction effect might be that different travelers evaluate travel time differently. For example, one might argue that because women commonly take increased responsibility for home maintenance and child care, they are likely to evaluate increased travel time to work more negatively than men. This could be represented by adding a variable to the model which represents the product of a dummy variable for female (one if the traveler is a woman and zero otherwise) times travel time, as illustrated below in the utility equations for a three alternative mode choice example (Drive Alone, Shared Ride, and Transit) using the same notation described previously. \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{DA},S_{i})=\\gamma_{1}\\times TT_{DA}+\\gamma_{2}\\times TT_{DA}\\times Fem+\\gamma_{3}\\times TC_{DA} \\tag{3.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{SR},S_{i})=\\gamma_{1}\\times TT_{SR}+\\gamma_{2}\\times TT_{SR}\\times Fem+\\gamma_{3}\\times TC_{SR} \\tag{3.17} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{TR},S_{i})=\\gamma_{1}\\times TT_{TR}+\\gamma_{2}\\times TT_{TR}\\times Fem+\\gamma_{3}\\times TC_{TR}+\\gamma_{4}\\times FREQ_{TR} \\tag{3.18} \\end{equation}\\] In this example, \\(\\gamma_1\\) represents the utility value of one minute of travel time to men and \\(\\gamma_2\\) represents the additional utility value of one minute of travel time to women. Thus, the total utility value of one minute of travel time to women is \\(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2\\). In this case, \\(\\gamma_1\\), is expected to be negative indicating that increased travel time reduces the utility of an alternative. \\(\\gamma_2\\) may be negative or positive, indicating that women are more or less sensitive to increases in travel time. 3.5 Specification of the Additive Error Term As described in section 3.3, the utility of each alternative is represented by a deterministic component, which is represented in the utility function by observed and measured variables, and an additive error term, \\(\\epsilon_i\\) which represents those components of the utility function which are not included in the model. In the three alternative examples used above, the total utility of each alternative can be represented by: \\[\\begin{equation} U_{DA}=V(S_t)+V(X_{DA})+V(S_t,X_{DA})+\\epsilon_{DA} \\tag{3.19} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} U_{SR}=V(S_t)+V(X_{SR})+V(S_t,X_{SR})+\\epsilon_{SR} \\tag{3.20} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} U_{TR}=V(S_t)+V(X_{TR})+V(S_t,X_{TR})+\\epsilon_{TR} \\tag{3.21} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(V()\\) represents the deterministics components of the utility for the alternatives, and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) represents the random components of the utility, also called the error term. The error term is included in the utility function to account for the fact that the analyst is not able to completely and correctly measure or specify all attributes that determine travelers’ mode utility assessment. By definition, error terms are unobserved and unmeasured. A wide range of distributions could be used to represent the distribution of error terms over individuals and alternatives. If we assume that the error term for each alternative represents many missing components, each of which has relatively little impact on the value of each alternative, the central limit theorem suggests that the sum of these small errors will be distributed normally. This assumption leads to the formulation of the Multinomial Probit (MNP) probabilistic choice model. However, the mathematical complexity of the MNP model; which makes it difficult to estimate, interpret and predict; has limited its use in practice. An alternative distribution assumption, described in the next chapter, leads to the formulation of the multinomial logit (MNL) model. "],

Such models have numerous applications since many behavioral responses are discrete or qualitative in nature; that is, they correspond to choices of one or another of a set of alternatives. The ultimate interest in discrete choice modeling, as in most econometric modeling, lies in being able to predict the decision making behavior of a group of individuals (we will use the term “individual” and “decision maker” interchangeably, though the decision maker may be an individual, a household, a shipper, an organization, or some other decision making entity). A further interest is to determine the relative influence of different attributes of alternatives and characteristics of decision makers when they make choice decisions. For example, transportation analysts may be interested in predicting the fraction of commuters using each of several travel modes under a variety of service conditions, or marketing researchers may be interested in examining the fraction of car buyers selecting each of several makes and models with different prices and attributes. Further, they may be interested in predicting this fraction for different groups of individuals and identifying individuals who are most likely to favor one or another alternative. Similarly, they may be interested in understanding how different groups value different attributes of an alternative; for example are business air travelers more sensitive to total travel time or the frequency of flight departures for a chosen destination. There are two basic ways of modeling such aggregate (or group) behavior. One approach directly models the aggregate share of all or a segment of decision makers choosing each alternative as a function of the characteristics of the alternatives and socio-demographic attributes of the group. This approach is commonly referred to as the aggregate approach. The second approach is to recognize that aggregate behavior is the result of numerous individual decisions and to model individual choice responses as a function of the characteristics of the alternatives available to and socio-demographic attributes of each individual. This second approach is referred to as the disaggregate approach. The disaggregate approach has several important advantages over the aggregate approach to modeling the decision making behavior of a group of individuals. First, the disaggregate approach explains why an individual makes a particular choice given her/his circumstances and is, therefore, better able to reflect changes in choice behavior due to changes in individual characteristics and attributes of alternatives. The aggregate approach, on the other hand, rests primarily on statistical associations among relevant variables at a level other than that of the decision maker; as a result, it is unable to provide accurate and reliable estimates of the change in choice behavior due changes in service or in the population. Second, the disaggregate approach, because of its causal nature, is likely to be more transferable to a different point in time and to a different geographic context, a critical requirement for prediction. Third, discrete choice models are being increasingly used to understand behavior so that the behavior may be changed in a proactive manner through carefully designed strategies that modify the attributes of alternatives which are important to individual decision makers. The disaggregate approach is more suited for proactive policy analysis since it is causal, less tied to the estimation data and more likely to include a range of relevant policy variables. Fourth, the disaggregate approach is more efficient than the aggregate approach in terms of model reliability per unit cost of data collection. Disaggregate data provide substantial variation in the behavior of interest and in the determinants of that behavior, enabling the efficient estimation of model parameters. On the other hand, aggregation leads to considerable loss in variability, thus requiring much more data to obtain the same level of model precision. Finally, disaggregate models, if properly specified, will obtain un-biased parameter estimates, while aggregate model estimates are known to produce biased (i.e. incorrect) parameter estimates. 1.2 Use of Disaggregate Discrete Choice Models The behavioral nature of disaggregate models, and the associated advantages of such models over aggregate models, has led to the widespread use of disaggregate discrete choice methods in travel demand modeling. A few of these application contexts below with references to recent work in these areas are: travel mode choice (reviewed in detail later), destination choice (C. Bhat, Govindarajan, and Pulugurta 1998; Train 1998), route choice (Yai, Iwakura, and Morichi 1997; Cascetta et al. 2002; Erhardt et al. 2003; Gliebe and Koppelman 2002), air travel choices (Proussaloglou and Koppelman 1999), activity analysis (Wen and Koppelman 1999) and auto ownership, brand and model choice (Train and others 1994; C. R. Bhat and Pulugurta 1998). Choice models have also been applied in several other fields such as purchase incidence and brand choice in marketing (Kalyanam and Putler 1997; Bucklin, Gupta, and Han 1995), housing type and location choice in geography (Waddell 1993; Evers 1990; William Sermons and Koppelman 1998), choice of intercity air carrier (Proussaloglou and Koppelman 1999) and investment choices of finance firms (Corres, Hajivassiliou, and Ioannides 1993). 1.3 Application Context in Current Course In this self-instructing course, we focus on the travel mode choice decision. Within the travel demand modeling field, mode choice is arguably the single most important determinant of the number of vehicles on roadways. The use of high-occupancy vehicle modes (such as ridesharing arrangements and transit) leads to more efficient use of the roadway infrastructure, less traffic congestion, and lower mobile-source emissions as compared to the use of single-occupancy vehicles. Further, the mode choice decision is the most easily influenced travel decision for many trips. There is a vast literature on travel mode choice modeling which has provided a good understanding of factors which influence mode choice and the general range of trade-offs individuals are willing to make among level-of-service variables (such as travel time and travel cost). The emphasis on travel mode choice in this course is a result of its important policy implications, the extensive literature to guide its development, and the limited number of alternatives involved in this decision (typically, 3 – 7 alternatives). While the methods discussed here are equally applicable to cases with many alternatives, a limited number of mode choice alternatives enable us to focus the course on important concepts and issues in discrete choice modeling without being distracted by the mechanics and presentation complexity associated with larger choice sets. 1.4 Urban and Intercity Travel Mode Choice Modeling The mode choice decision has been examined both in the context of urban travel as well as intercity travel. 1.4.1 Urban Travel Mode Choice Modeling Many metropolitan areas are plagued by a continuing increase in traffic congestion resulting in motorist frustration, longer travel times, lost productivity, increased accidents and automobile insurance rates, more fuel consumption, increased freight transportation costs, and deterioration in air quality. Aware of these serious consequences of traffic congestion, metropolitan areas are examining and implementing transportation congestion management (TCM) policies. Urban travel mode choice models are used to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM policies in shifting single-occupancy vehicle users to high-occupancy vehicle modes. The focus of urban travel mode choice modeling has been on the home-based work trip. All major metropolitan planning organizations estimate home-based work travel mode choice models as part of their transportation planning process. Most of these models include only motorized modes, though increasingly non-motorized modes (walk and bike) are being included (Lawton 1989; Purvis 1997). The modeling of home-based non-work trips and non-home-based trips has received less attention in the urban travel mode choice literature. However, the increasing number of these trips and their contribution to traffic congestion has recently led to more extensive development of models for these trip purposes in some metropolitan regions (for example, Iglesias 1997; Marshall and Ballard 1998). In this course, we discuss model-building and specification issues for home-based work and home-based shop/other trips within an urban context, though the same concepts can be immediately extended to other trip purposes and locales. 1.4.2 Intercity Mode Choice Models Increasing congestion on intercity highways and at intercity air terminals has raised serious concerns about the adverse impacts of such congestion on regional economic development, national productivity and competitiveness, and environmental quality. To alleviate current and projected congestion, attention has been directed toward identifying and evaluating alternative proposals to improve intercity transportation services. These proposals include expanding or constructing new express roadways and airports, upgrading conventional rail services and providing new high-speed ground transportation services using advanced technologies. Among other things, the a priori evaluation of such large scale projects requires the estimation of reliable intercity mode choice models to predict ridership share on the proposed new or improved intercity service and identify the modes from which existing intercity travelers will be diverted to the new (or improved) service. Intercity travel mode choice models are usually segmented by purpose (business versus pleasure), day of travel (weekday versus weekend), party size (traveling individually versus group travel), etc. The travel modes in such models typically include car, rail, air, and bus modes (Koppelman and Wen 1998; C. R. Bhat 1998; and Marwick 1993). This manual examines issues of urban model choice; however, the vast majority of approaches and specifications can and have been used in intercity mode choice modeling. 1.5 Description of the Course This self-instructing course (SIC) is designed for readers who have some familiarity with transportation planning methods and background in travel model estimation. It updates and extends the previous SIC Manual (Horowitz, Koppelman, and Lerman 1986) in a number of important ways. First, it is more rigorous in the mathematical details reflecting increased awareness and application of discrete choice models over the past decade. The course is intended to enhance the understanding of model structure and estimation procedures more so than it is intended to introduce discrete choice modeling (readers with no background in discrete choice modeling may want to work first with the earlier SIC). Second, this SIC emphasizes “hands-on” estimation experience using data sets obtained from planning and decision-oriented surveys. Consequently, there is more emphasis on data structure and more extensive examination of model specification issues. Update: this manual uses the same models and data as the 2006 Bhat / Koppelman SIC, but the models are executed in R, with the data available for download and the estimation code exposed to the reader. Third, this SIC extends the range of travel modes to include non-motorized modes and discusses issues involved in including such modes in the analysis. Fourth, this SIC includes detailed coverage of the nested logit model which is being used more commonly in many metropolitan planning organizations today. 1.6 Organization of the Course Structure This course manual is divided into twelve chapters or modules. CHAPTER 1, this chapter, provides an introduction to the course. [CHAPTER 2][Elements of the Choice Decision Process] describes the elements of the choice process including the decision maker, the alternatives, the attributes of the alternative, and the decision rule(s) adopted by the decision maker in making his/her choice. [CHAPTER 3][Utility-based Choice Theory] introduces the basic concepts of utility theory followed by a discussion of probabilistic and deterministic choice concepts and the technical components of the utility function. [CHAPTER 4][The Multinomial Logit Model] describes the Multinomial Logit (MNL) Model in detail. The discussion includes the functional form of the model, its mathematical properties, and the practical implications of these properties in model development and application. The chapter concludes with an overview of methods used for estimating the model parameters. In [CHAPTER 5][#estimation-chapter], we first discuss the data requirements for developing disaggregate mode choice models, the potential sources for these data, and the format in which these data need to be organized for estimation. Next, the data sets used in this manual, i.e., the San Francisco Bay Area 1990 work trip mode choice (for urban area journey to work travel) and the San Francisco Bay Area Shop/Other 1990 mode choice data (for non-work travel), are described. This is followed by the development of a basic work mode choice model specification. The estimation results of this model specification are reviewed with a comprehensive discussion of informal and formal tests to evaluate the appropriateness of model parameters and the overall goodness-of-fit statistics of the model. [CHAPTER 6][#specification-chapter] describes and demonstrates the process by which the utility function specification for the work mode choice model can be refined using intuition, statistical analysis, testing, and judgment. Many specifications of the utility function are explored for both data sets to demonstrate some of the most common specification forms and testing methods. Starting from a base model, incremental changes are made to the modal utility functions with the objective of finding a model specification that performs better statistically, and is consistent with theory and our a priori expectations about mode choice behavior. The appropriateness of each specification change is evaluated using judgment and statistical tests. This process leads to a preferred specification for the work mode choice MNL model. [CHAPTER 7][San Francisco Bay Area Shop / Other Mode Choice] parallels [CHAPTER 6][Model Specification Refinement] for the shop/other mode choice model. [CHAPTER 8][Nested Logit Model] introduces the Nested Logit (NL) Model. The Chapter begins with the motivation for the NL model to address one of the major limitations of the MNL. The functional form and the mathematical properties of the NL are discussed in detail. This is followed by a presentation of estimation results for a number of NL model structures for the work and shop/other data sets. Based on these estimation results, statistical tests are used to compare the various NL model structures with the corresponding MNL. [CHAPTER 9][Selecting a Preferred Nesting Structure] describes the issues involved in formulating, estimating and selecting a preferred NL model. The results of statistical tests are used in conjunction with our a priori understanding of the competitive structure among different alternatives to select a final preferred nesting structure. The practical implications of choosing this preferred nesting structure in comparison to the MNL model are discussed. [CHAPTER 11][Aggregate Forecasting Assessment, and Application] describes how models estimated from disaggregate data can be used to predict a aggregate mode choice for a group of individuals from relevant information regarding the altered value (due to socio-demographic changes or policy actions) of exogenous variables. The chapter also discusses issues related to the aggregate assessment of the performance of mode choice models and the application of the models to evaluate policy actions. [CHAPTER 12][Recent Advances in Discrete Choice Modeling] provides an overview of the motivation for and structure of advanced discrete choice models. The discussion is intended to familiarize readers with a variety of models that allow increased flexibility in the representation of the choice behavior than those allowed by the multinomial logit and nested logit models. It does not provide the detailed mathematical formulations or the estimation techniques for these advanced models. Appropriate references are provided for readers interested in this information.

However, we generally do not have information about the process individuals use to arrive at their observed choice. A proposed framework for the choice process is that an individual first determines the available alternatives; next, evaluates the attributes of each alternative relevant to the choice under consideration; and then, uses a decision rule to select an alternative from among the available alternatives (N. Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985), Chapter 3). Some individuals might select a particular alternative without going through the structured process presented above. For example, an individual might decide to buy a car of the same make and model as a friend because the friend is happy with the car or is a car expert. Or an individual might purchase the same brand of ice cream out of habit. However, even in these cases, one can view the behavior within the framework of a structured decision process by assuming that the individual generates only one alternative for consideration (which is also the one chosen). In the subsequent sections, we discuss four elements associated with the choice process; the decision maker, the alternatives, the attributes of alternatives and the decision rule. 2.2 The Decision Maker The decision maker in each choice situation is the individual, group or institution which has the responsibility to make the decision at hand. The decision maker will depend on the specific choice situation. For example, the decision maker will be the individual in college choice, career choice, travel mode choice, etc.; the household in residential location choice, vacation destination choice, number of cars owned, etc.; the firm in office or warehouse location, carrier choice, employee hiring, etc. or the State (in the selection of roadway alignments). A common characteristic in the study of choice is that different decision makers face different choice situations and can have different tastes (that is, they value attributes differently). For example, in travel mode choice modeling, two individuals with different income levels and different residential locations are likely to have different sets of modes to choose from and may place different importance weights on travel time, travel cost and other attributes. These differences among decision makers should be explicitly considered in choice modeling; consequently, it is important to develop choice models at the level of the decision maker and to include variables which represent differences among the decision makers. 2.3 The Alternatives Individuals make a choice from a set of alternatives available to them. The set of available alternatives may be constrained by the environment. For example, high speed rail between two cities is an alternative only if the two cities are connected by high speed rail. The choice set determined by the environment is referred to as the universal choice set. However, even if an alternative is present in the universal choice set, it may not be feasible for a particular individual. Feasibility of an alternative for an individual in the context of travel mode choice may be determined by legal regulations (a person cannot drive alone until the age of 16), economic constraints (limousine service is not feasible for some people) or characteristics of the individual (no car available or a handicap that prevents one from driving). The subset of the universal choice set that is feasible for an individual is defined as the feasible choice set for that individual. Finally, not all alternatives in the feasible choice set may be considered by an individual in her/his choice process. For example, transit might be a feasible travel mode for an individual’s work trip, but the individual might not be aware of the availability or schedule of the transit service. The subset of the feasible choice set that an individual actually considers is referred to as the consideration choice set. This is the choice set which should be considered when modeling choice decisions. The choice set may also be determined by the decision context of the individual or the focus of the policy makers supporting the study. For example, a study of university choice may focus on choice of school type (private vs. public, small vs. large, urban vs. suburban or rural location, etc.), if the perspective is national, or a choice of specific schools, if the perspective is regional. 2.4 Attributes of Alternatives The alternatives in a choice process are characterized by a set of attribute values. Following Lancaster (1971), one can postulate that the attractiveness of an alternative is determined by the value of its attributes. The measure of uncertainty about an attribute can also be included as part of the attribute vector in addition to the attribute itself. For example, if travel time by transit is not fixed, the expected value of transit travel time and a measure of uncertainty of the transit travel time can both be included as attributes of transit. The attributes of alternatives may be generic (that is, they apply to all alternatives equally) or alternative-specific (they apply to one or a subset of alternatives). In the travel mode choice context, in-vehicle-time is usually considered to be specific to all motorized modes because it is relevant to motorized alternatives. However, if travel time by bus is considered to be very onerous due to over-crowding, bus in-vehicle-time may be defined as a distinct variable with a distinct parameter; differences between this parameter and the in-vehicle-time parameter for other motorized modes will measure the degree to which bus time is considered onerous to the traveler relative to other in-vehicle time. Other times, such as wait time at a transit stop or transfer time at a transit transfer point are relevant only to the transit modes, not for the nontransit modes. It is also common to consider the travel times for non-motorized modes (bike and walk) as specific to only these alternatives. An important reason for developing discrete choice models is to evaluate the effect of policy actions. To provide this capability, it is important to identify and include attributes whose values may be changed through pro-active policy decisions. In a travel mode choice context, these variables include measures of service (travel time, frequency, reliability of service, etc.) and travel cost. 2.5 The Decision Rule An individual invokes a decision rule (i.e., a mechanism to process information and evaluate alternatives) to select an alternative from a choice set with two or more alternatives. This decision rule may include random choice, variety seeking, or other processes which we refer to as being irrational. As indicated earlier, some individuals might use other decision rules such as “follow the leader” or habit in choosing alternatives which may also be considered to be irrational. However, even in this case, rational discrete choice models may be effective if the decision maker who adopts habitual behavior previously evaluated different alternatives and selected the best one for him/her and there have been no intervening changes in her/his alternatives and preferences. However, in the case of follow-the-leader behavior, the decision maker is considered to be rational if the “leader” is believed to share a similar value system. An individual is said to use a rational decision process if the process satisfies two fundamental constructs: consistency and transitivity. Consistency implies the same choice selection in repeated choices under identical circumstances. Transitivity implies an unique ordering of alternatives on a preference scale. Therefore, if alternative A is preferred to alternative B and alternative B is preferred to alternative C, then alternative A is preferred to alternative C. A number of possible rules fall under the purview of rational decision processes (N. Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985), Chapter 3). In this course, the focus will be on one such decision rule referred to as utility maximization. The utility maximization rule is based on two fundamental concepts. The first is that the attribute vector characterizing each alternative can be reduced to a scalar utility value for that alternative. This concept implies a compensatory decision process; that is, it presumes that individuals make “trade-offs” among the attributes characterizing alternatives in determining their choice. Thus, an individual may choose a costlier travel mode if the travel time reduction offered by that mode compensates for the increased cost. The second concept is that the individual selects the alternative with the highest utility value. The focus on utility maximization in this course is based on its strong theoretical background, extensive use in the development of human decision making concepts, and amenability to statistical testing of the effects of attributes on choice. The utility maximization rule is also robust; that is, it provides a good description of the choice behavior even in cases where individuals use somewhat different decision rules. In the next chapter, we discuss the concepts and underlying principles of utility based choice theory in more detail. References "],

Generally, we think about utility as being derived from the attributes of alternatives or sets of alternatives; e.g., the total set of groceries purchased in a week. The utility maximization rule states that an individual will select the alternative from his/her set of available alternatives that maximizes his or her utility. Further, the rule implies that there is a function containing attributes of alternatives and characteristics of individuals that describes an individual’s utility valuation for each alternative. The utility function, \\(U\\), has the property that an alternative is chosen if its utility is greater than the utility of all other alternatives in the individual’s choice set. Alternatively, this can be stated as alternative, \\(&#39;i&#39;\\), is chosen among a set of alternatives, if and only if the utility of alternative, \\(&#39;i&#39;\\), is greater than or equal to the utility of all alternatives , \\(&#39;j&#39;\\), in the choice set, \\(C\\). This can be expressed mathematically as: \\[\\begin{equation} U(X_i,S_t) \\geq U(X_j,S_t) \\forall j \\Rightarrow i \\succ j \\forall j \\in C \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(U(~~~)\\) is the mathematical utility function, \\(X_i,X_j\\) are vectors of attributes describing alternatives i and j, respectively (e.g., travel time, travel cost, and other relevant attributes of the available modes), \\(S_t\\) is a vector of characteristics describing individual \\(t\\), that influence his/her preferences among alternatives (e.g., household income and number of automobiles owned for travel mode choice), \\(i \\succ j\\) means the alternative to the left is preferred to the alternative to the right, and \\(\\forall j\\) means all the cases, j, in the choice set. That is, if the utility of alternative \\(i\\) is greater than or equal to the utility of all alternatives, \\(j\\); alternative \\(i\\) will be preferred and chosen from the set of alternatives, \\(C\\). The underlying concept of utility allows us to rank a series of alternatives and identify the single alternative that has highest utility. The primary implication of this ranking or ordering of alternatives is that there is no absolute reference or zero point, for utility values. Thus, the only valuation that is important is the difference in utility between pairs of alternatives; particularly whether that difference is positive or negative. Any function that produces the same preference orderings can serve as a utility function and will give the same predictions of choice, regardless of the numerical values of the utilities assigned to individual alternatives. It also follows that utility functions, which result in the same order among alternatives, are equivalent. 3.2 Deterministic Choice Concepts The utility maximization rule, which states that an individual chooses the alternative with the highest utility, implies no uncertainty in the individual’s decision process; that is, the individual is certain to choose the highest ranked alternative under the observed choice conditions. Utility models that yield certain predictions of choice are called deterministic utility models. The application of deterministic utility to the case of a decision between two alternatives is illustrated in Figure 3.1 that portrays a utility space in which the utilities of alternatives 1 and 2 are plotted along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively, for each individual. The 45° line represents those points for which the utilities of the two alternatives are equal. Individuals B, C and D (above the equal-utility line) have higher utility for alternative 2 than for alternative 1 and are certain to choose alternative 2. Similarly, individuals A, E, and F (below the line) have higher utility for alternative 1 and are certain to choose that alternative. If deterministic utility models described behavior correctly, we would expect that an individual would make the same choice over time and that similar individuals (individuals having the same individual and household characteristics), would make the same choices when faced with the same set of alternatives. In practice, however, we observe variations in an individual’s choice and different choices among apparently similar individuals when faced with similar or even identical alternatives. For example, in studies of work trip mode choice, it is commonly observed that individuals, who are represented as having identical personal characteristics and who face the same sets of travel alternatives, choose different modes of travel to work. Further, some of these individuals vary their choices from day to day for no observable reason resulting in observed choices which appear to contradict the utility evaluations; that is, person A may choose Alternative 2 even though \\(U_1 &gt; U_2\\) or person C may choose Alternative 2 even though \\(U_2 &gt; U_1\\) . These observations raise questions about the appropriateness of deterministic utility models for modeling travel or other human behavior. The challenge is to develop a model structure that provides a reasonable representation of these unexplained variations in travel behavior. tibble(U1 = c(2.5, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6), U2 = c(1, 4, 5, 7, 4, 5), label = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = U1, y = U2, label = label)) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Utility for Alternative 1&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Utility for Alternative 2&quot;) + geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, lty = &quot;dotted&quot;) + geom_label() + geom_text(data = tibble(U1 = c(2,5), U2 = c(6.5, 1.5), label= c(&quot;Alt. 2 Preferred&quot;, &quot;Alt. 1 Preferred&quot;))) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,8)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,8)) Figure 3.1: Illustration of Deterministic Choice There are three primary sources of error in the use of deterministic utility functions. First, the individual may have incomplete or incorrect information or misperceptions about the attributes of some or all of the alternatives. As a result, different individuals, each with different information or perceptions about the same alternatives are likely to make different choices. Second, the analyst or observer has different or incomplete information about the same attributes relative to the individuals and an inadequate understanding of the function the individual uses to evaluate the utility of each alternative. For example, the analyst may not have good measures of the reliability of a particular transit service, the likelihood of getting a seat at a particular time of day or the likelihood of finding a parking space at a suburban rail station. However, the traveler, especially if he/she is a regular user, is likely to know these things or to have opinions about them. Third, the analyst is unlikely to know, or account for, specific circumstances of the individual’s travel decision. For example, an individual’s choice of mode for the work trip may depend on whether there are family visitors or that another family member has a special travel need on a particular day. Using models which do not account for and incorporate this lack of information results in the apparent behavioral inconsistencies described above. While human behavior may be argued to be inconsistent, it can also be argued that the inconsistency is only apparent and can be attributed to the analyst’s lack of knowledge regarding the individual’s decision making process. Models that take account of this lack of information on the part of the analyst are called random utility or probabilistic choice models. 3.3 Probabilistic Choice Theory If analysts thoroughly understood all aspects of the internal decision making process of choosers as well as their perception of alternatives, they would be able to describe that process and predict mode choice using deterministic utility models. Experience has shown, however, that analysts do not have such knowledge; they do not fully understand the decision process of each individual or their perceptions of alternatives and they have no realistic possibility of obtaining this information. Therefore, mode choice models should take a form that recognizes and accommodates the analyst’s lack of information and understanding. The data and models used by analysts describe preferences and choice in terms of probabilities of choosing each alternative rather than predicting that an individual will choose a particular mode with certainty. Effectively, these probabilities reflect the population probabilities that people with the given set of characteristics and facing the same set of alternatives choose each of the alternatives. As with deterministic choice theory, the individual is assumed to choose an alternative if its utility is greater than that of any other alternative. The probability prediction of the analyst results from differences between the estimated utility values and the utility values used by the traveler. We represent this difference by decomposing the utility of the alternative, from the perspective of the decision maker, into two components. One component of the utility function represents the portion of the utility observed by the analyst, often called the deterministic (or observable) portion of the utility. The other component is the difference between the unknown utility used by the individual and the utility estimated by the analyst. Since the utility used by the decision maker is unknown, we represent this difference as a random error. Formally, we represent this by: \\[\\begin{equation} U_{it} = V_{it} + \\epsilon_{it} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(U_{it}\\) is the true utility of the alternative \\(i\\) to the decision maker \\(t\\), (\\(U_{it}\\) is equivalent to \\(U(X_i,S_t)\\) but provides a simpler notation), \\(V_{it}\\) is the deterministic or observable portion of the utility estimated by the analyst, and \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) is the error or the portion of the utility unkown to the analyst. The analyst does not have any information about the error term. However, the total error which is the sum of errors from many sources (imperfect information, measurement errors, omission of modal attributes, omission of the characteristics of the individual that influence his/her choice decision and/or errors in the utility function) is represented by a random variable. Different assumptions about the distribution of the random variables associated with the utility of each alternative result in different representations of the model used to describe and predict choice probabilities. The assumptions used in the development of logit type models are discussed in the next Chapter. 3.4 Components of the Deterministic Portion of the Utility Function The deterministic or observable portion (often called the systematic portion) of the utility of an alternative is a mathematical function of the attributes of the alternative and the characteristics of the decision maker. The systematic portion of utility can have any mathematical form but the function is most generally formulated as additive to simplify the estimation process. This function includes unknown parameters which are estimated in the modeling process. The systematic portion of the utility function can be broken into components that are (1) exclusively related to the attributes of alternatives, (2) exclusively related to the characteristics of the decision maker and (3) represent interactions between the attributes of alternatives and the characteristics of the decision maker. Thus, the systematic portion of utility can be represented by: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{t,i} = V(S_t) + V(X_i) + V(S_t,X_i) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(V_{it}\\) is the systematic portion of utility of alternative i for inidivual t, \\(V(S_t)\\) is the portion of utility associated with characteristics of individual \\(t\\), \\(V(X_i)\\) is the portion of utility of alternative \\(i\\) associated with the attributes of alternative \\(i\\), and \\(V(S_t,X_i)\\) is the portion of the utility which results from interactions between the attributes of alternative \\(i\\) and the characteristics of individual \\(t\\). Each of these utility components is discussed separately 3.4.1 Utility Associated with the Attributes of Alternatives The utility component associated exclusively with alternatives includes variables that describe the attributes of alternatives. These attributes influence the utility of each alternative for all people in the population of interest. The attributes considered for inclusion in this component are service attributes which are measurable and which are expected to influence people’s preferences/choices among alternatives. These include measures of travel time, travel cost, walk access distance, transfers required, crowding, seat availability, and others. For example: * Total travel time, * In-vehicle travel time, * Out-of-vehicle travel time, * Travel cost, * Number of transfers (transit modes), * Walk distance and, * Reliability of on time arrival. These measures differ across alternatives for the same individual and also among individuals due to differences in the origin and destination locations of each person’s travel. For example, this portion of the utility function could look like: \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_i) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ X_{i1} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ X_{i2} + L + \\gamma_k ~ &#39; ~ X_{ik} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\gamma_k\\) is the parameter which defines the direction and importance of the effect of attribute \\(k\\) on the utility of an alternative and \\(X_{ik}\\) is the value of attribute \\(k\\) for alternative \\(i\\). Thus, this portion of the utility of each alternative, \\(i\\), is the weighted sum of the attributes of alternative \\(i\\). A specific example for the Drive Alone (DA), Shared Ride (SR), and Transit (TR) alternatives is: \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{DA}) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ TT_{DA} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ TC_{DA} \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{SR}) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ TT_{SR} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ TC_{SR} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{TR}) = \\gamma_1 ~ &#39; ~ TT_{TR} + \\gamma_2 ~ &#39; ~ TC_{TR} + \\gamma_3 ~ &#39; ~ FREQ_{TR} \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(TT_i\\) is the travel time for mode \\(i\\) (\\(i\\) = \\(DA, SR, TR\\)) and \\(TC_i\\) is the travel cost for mode \\(i\\), and \\(FREQ_{TR}\\) is the frequency for transit services. Travel time and travel cost are generic; that is, they apply to all alternatives; frequency is specific to transit only. The parameters, \\(\\gamma_k\\), are identical for all the alternatives to which they apply. This implies that the utility value of travel time and travel cost are identical across alternatives. The possibility that travel time may be more onerous on Transit than by Drive Alone or Shared Ride could be tested by reformulating the above models to: \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{DA}) = \\gamma_{11} \\times TT_{DA} + \\gamma_{12} \\times 0 + \\gamma_2 \\times TC_{DA} \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{SR}) = \\gamma_{11} \\times TT_{SR} + \\gamma_{12} \\times 0 + \\gamma_2 \\times TC_{SR} \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{TR}) = \\gamma_{11} \\times 0 + \\gamma_{12} \\times TT_{TR} + \\gamma_2 \\times TC_{TR} + \\gamma_3 \\times FREQ_{TR} \\tag{3.10} \\end{equation}\\] That is, two distinct parameters would be estimated for travel time; one for travel time by DA and SR, \\(\\gamma_{11}\\), and the other for travel time by TR, \\(\\gamma_{12}\\). These parameters could be compared to determine if the differences are statistically significant or large enough to be important. 3.4.2 Utility ‘Biases’ Due to Excluded Variables It has been widely observed that decision makers exhibit preferences for alternatives which cannot be explained by the observed attributes of those alternatives. These preferences are described as alternative specific preference or bias; they measure the average preference of individuals with different characteristics for an alternative relative to a ‘reference’ alternative. As will be shown in CHAPTER 4, the selection of the reference alternative does not influence the interpretation of the model estimation results. In the simplest case, we assume that the bias is the same for all decision makers. In this case, this portion of the utility function would be: \\[\\begin{equation} Bias_i = \\beta_{i0} \\times ASC_i \\tag{3.11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{i0}\\) represents an increase in the utility of alternative \\(i\\) for all choosers and \\(ASC_i\\) is equal to one for alternative \\(i\\) and zero for all other alternatives. More detailed observation generally indicates that people with different personal and family characteristics have different preferences among sets of alternatives. For example, members of high income households are less likely to choose transit alternatives than low income individuals, all other things being equal. Similarly, members of households with fewer automobiles than workers are more likely to choose transit alternatives. Thus, it is useful to consider that the bias may differ across individuals as discussed in the next section. 3.4.3 Utility Related to the Characteristics of the Decision Maker The differences in ‘bias’ across individuals can be represented by incorporating personal and household variables in mode choice models. Variables commonly used for this purpose include: * Income of the traveler’s household, * Sex of traveler, * Age of traveler, * Number of automobiles in traveler’s household, * Number of workers in the traveler’s household, and * Number of adults in the traveler’s household. In some cases, these variables are combined. For example, the number of automobiles may be divided by the number of workers to indicate the availability of automobiles to each household member. This approach results in modification of the bias portion of the utility function to look like: \\[\\begin{equation} \\beta_{i0} \\times ASC_i + \\beta_{i1} \\times S_{1t} + \\beta_{i2} \\times S_{2t} + ... + \\beta_{iM} \\times S_{Mt} \\tag{3.12} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{im}\\) is the parameter which defines the direction and magnitude of the incremental bias due to an increase in the \\(m^{th}\\) characteristic of the decision maker (\\(m = 0\\) represents the parameter associated with the alternative specific constant) and \\(S_{mt}\\) is the value of the \\(m^{th}\\) characteristics for individual \\(t\\). For the case of three alternatives, (Drive Alone, Shared Ride and Transit), the decision maker components of the utility functions are: \\[\\begin{equation} V(S_{DA})=\\beta_{DA,0}\\times1+\\beta_{DA,1}\\times Inc_{t}+\\beta_{DA,2}\\times NCar_{t} \\tag{3.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(S_{SR})=\\beta_{SR,0}\\times1+\\beta_{SR,1}\\times Inc_{t}+\\beta_{SR,2}\\times NCar_{t} \\tag{3.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(S_{TR})=\\beta_{SR,0}\\times1+\\beta_{TR,1}\\times Inc_{t}+\\beta_{TR,2}\\times NCar_{t} \\tag{3.15} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{i0}\\) is the modal bias constant for mode \\(i\\) (\\(i\\)=DA,SR,TR), \\(Inc_{t}\\) is the household income of the traveler, \\(NCar_{t}\\) is the number of cars in the traveler’s household, and \\(\\beta_{i1}\\),\\(\\beta_{i2}\\) are mode specific parameters on income and cars, respectively, for mode \\(i\\) (\\(i\\)=DA,SR,TR) It is important to recognize that the parameters that describe the effect of traveler characteristics differ across alternatives while the variables are identical across alternatives for each individual. 3.4.4 Utility Defined by Interactions between Alternative Attributes and Decision Maker Characteristics The final component of utility takes into account differences in how attributes are evaluated by different decision makers. One effect of income, described earlier, is to increase the preference for travel by private automobile. This representation implies that the preference for DA and SR increase with income, independent of the attributes of travel by each alternative. Another way to represent the influence of income is that increasing income reduces the importance of monetary cost in the evaluation of modal alternatives. The idea that high income travelers place less importance on cost can be represented by dividing the cost of travel of an alternative by annual income or some function of annual income of the traveler or his/her household. Another interaction effect might be that different travelers evaluate travel time differently. For example, one might argue that because women commonly take increased responsibility for home maintenance and child care, they are likely to evaluate increased travel time to work more negatively than men. This could be represented by adding a variable to the model which represents the product of a dummy variable for female (one if the traveler is a woman and zero otherwise) times travel time, as illustrated below in the utility equations for a three alternative mode choice example (Drive Alone, Shared Ride, and Transit) using the same notation described previously. \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{DA},S_{i})=\\gamma_{1}\\times TT_{DA}+\\gamma_{2}\\times TT_{DA}\\times Fem+\\gamma_{3}\\times TC_{DA} \\tag{3.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{SR},S_{i})=\\gamma_{1}\\times TT_{SR}+\\gamma_{2}\\times TT_{SR}\\times Fem+\\gamma_{3}\\times TC_{SR} \\tag{3.17} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V(X_{TR},S_{i})=\\gamma_{1}\\times TT_{TR}+\\gamma_{2}\\times TT_{TR}\\times Fem+\\gamma_{3}\\times TC_{TR}+\\gamma_{4}\\times FREQ_{TR} \\tag{3.18} \\end{equation}\\] In this example, \\(\\gamma_1\\) represents the utility value of one minute of travel time to men and \\(\\gamma_2\\) represents the additional utility value of one minute of travel time to women. Thus, the total utility value of one minute of travel time to women is \\(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2\\). In this case, \\(\\gamma_1\\), is expected to be negative indicating that increased travel time reduces the utility of an alternative. \\(\\gamma_2\\) may be negative or positive, indicating that women are more or less sensitive to increases in travel time. 3.5 Specification of the Additive Error Term As described in section 3.3, the utility of each alternative is represented by a deterministic component, which is represented in the utility function by observed and measured variables, and an additive error term, \\(\\epsilon_i\\) which represents those components of the utility function which are not included in the model. In the three alternative examples used above, the total utility of each alternative can be represented by: \\[\\begin{equation} U_{DA}=V(S_t)+V(X_{DA})+V(S_t,X_{DA})+\\epsilon_{DA} \\tag{3.19} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} U_{SR}=V(S_t)+V(X_{SR})+V(S_t,X_{SR})+\\epsilon_{SR} \\tag{3.20} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} U_{TR}=V(S_t)+V(X_{TR})+V(S_t,X_{TR})+\\epsilon_{TR} \\tag{3.21} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(V()\\) represents the deterministics components of the utility for the alternatives, and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) represents the random components of the utility, also called the error term. The error term is included in the utility function to account for the fact that the analyst is not able to completely and correctly measure or specify all attributes that determine travelers’ mode utility assessment. By definition, error terms are unobserved and unmeasured. A wide range of distributions could be used to represent the distribution of error terms over individuals and alternatives. If we assume that the error term for each alternative represents many missing components, each of which has relatively little impact on the value of each alternative, the central limit theorem suggests that the sum of these small errors will be distributed normally. This assumption leads to the formulation of the Multinomial Probit (MNP) probabilistic choice model. However, the mathematical complexity of the MNP model; which makes it difficult to estimate, interpret and predict; has limited its use in practice. An alternative distribution assumption, described in the next chapter, leads to the formulation of the multinomial logit (MNL) model. "],

The specific assumptions that lead to the Multinomial Logit Model are (1) the error components are extreme-value (or Gumbel) distributed, (2) the error components are identically and independently distributed across alternatives, and (3) the error components are identically and independently distributed across observations/individuals. We discuss each of these assumptions below. The most common assumption for error distributions in the statistical and modeling literature is that errors are distributed normally. There are good theoretical and practical reasons for using the normal distribution for many modeling applications. However, in the case of choice models the normal distribution assumption for error terms leads to the Multinomial Probit Model (MNP) which has some properties that make it difficult to use in choice analysis.1 The Gumbel distribution is selected because it has computational advantages in a context where maximization is important, closely approximates the normal distribution (see Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2) and produces a closed-form2 probabilistic choice model. pdf &lt;- tibble( x = seq(-5, 5, by = 0.01), Normal = dnorm(x, sd = sqrt(pi^2/6)), Gumbel = exp(-x) * exp(-exp(-x)) ) ggplot(pdf %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;Distribution&quot;, value = &quot;Probability&quot;, -x), aes(x = x, y = Probability, color = Distribution)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() Figure 4.1: Probability density function for normal and Gumbel distributions. cdf &lt;- tibble( x = seq(-4, 5, by = 0.01), Normal = pnorm(x, sd = sqrt(pi^2 / 6)), Gumbel = exp(-exp(-x)) ) ggplot(cdf %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;Distribution&quot;, value = &quot;Probability&quot;, -x), aes(x = x, y = Probability, color = Distribution)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() Figure 4.2: Cumulative density function for normal and Gumbel distributions. The Gumbel has the following cumulative distribution and probability density functions: \\[\\begin{equation} F(\\epsilon) = e^{e^{-\\mu(\\epsilon-\\eta)}} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f(\\epsilon) = \\mu e^{-\\mu(\\epsilon-\\eta)} \\times e^{e^{-\\mu(\\epsilon-\\eta)}} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the scale parameter which determines the variance of the distribution and \\(\\eta\\) is the location (mode) parameter. The mean and variance of the distribution are: \\[\\begin{equation} Mean = \\eta + \\frac{0.577}{\\mu} \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Variance = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\mu^2} \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] The second and third assumptions state the location and variance of the distribution just as \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) indicate the location and variance of the normal distribution. We will return to the discussion of the independence between/among alternatives in CHAPTER 8. The three assumptions, taken together, lead to the mathematical structure known as the Multinomial Logit Model (MNL), which gives the choice probabilities of each alternative as a function of the systematic portion of the utility of all the alternatives. The general expression for the probability of choosing an alternative ‘i’ (i = 1,2,.., J) from a set of J alternatives is: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(i) = \\frac{\\exp(V_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\exp(V_j)} \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(Pr(i)\\) is the probability of the decision-make choosing alternative i and \\(V_j\\) is the systematic component of the utility of alternative j. The exponential function is described in Figure 4.3 which shows the relationship between \\(\\exp(V_i)\\) and \\(V_i\\). Note that \\(\\exp(V_i)\\) is always positive and increases monotonically with \\(V_i\\). tibble( x = seq(-3,3,.1), y = exp(x)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line() + xlab(bquote(V[i])) + ylab(bquote(exp(V[i]))) + theme_bw() Figure 4.3: Relationship Between \\(V_i\\) and \\(\\exp(V_i)\\) The multinomial logit (MNL) model has several important properties. We illustrate these for a case in which the decision maker has three available alternatives: Drive Alone (DA), Shared Ride (SR), and TRansit (TR). The probabilities of each alternative are given by modifying equation 4.5 for each alternative to obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(DA) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{DA})}{\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})} \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(SR) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{SR})}{\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})} \\tag{4.7} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(TR) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{TR})}{\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})} \\tag{4.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Pr(DA)\\), \\(Pr(SR)\\), and \\(Pr(TR)\\) are the probabilities of the decision-maker choosing drive alone, shared ride and transit, respectively, and \\(V_{DA}\\), \\(V_{SR}\\) and \\(V_{TR}\\) are the systematic components of the utility for drive alone, shared ride, and transit alternatives, respectively. It is common to replace these three equations by a single general equation to represent the probability of any alternative and to simplify the equation by replacing the explicit summation in the denominator by the summation over alternatives as: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(i) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{i})}{\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})} \\tag{4.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(i) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{i})}{\\sum_{j=DA,SR,TR}\\exp(V_j)} \\tag{4.10} \\end{equation}\\] where i indicates the alternative for which the probability is being computed. This formulation implies that the probability of choosing an alternative increases monotonically with an increase in the systematic utility of that alternative and decreases with increases in the systematic utility of each of the other alternatives. This is illustrated in Table 4.1 showing the probability of DA as a function of its own utility (with the utilities of other alternatives held constant) and in Table ?? as a function of the utility of other alternatives with its own utility fixed. tibble( case = 1:5, vda = c(-3.0, -1.5, 0.0, 1.5, 3.0), vsr = -1.5, vtr = -0.5 ) %&gt;% mutate( p = exp(vda) / (exp(vda) + exp(vsr) + exp(vtr)) ) %&gt;% kableExtra::kbl( caption = &quot;Probability Values for Drive Alone as a Function of Drive Alone Utility (Shared Ride and Transit Utilities held constant)&quot;, col.names = c(&quot;$Case$&quot;, &quot;$V_{DA}$&quot;, &quot;$V_{SR}$&quot;, &quot;$V_{TR}$&quot;, &quot;$Pr(DA)$&quot;)) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling() Table 4.1: Probability Values for Drive Alone as a Function of Drive Alone Utility (Shared Ride and Transit Utilities held constant) \\(Case\\) \\(V_{DA}\\) \\(V_{SR}\\) \\(V_{TR}\\) \\(Pr(DA)\\) 1 -3.0 -1.5 -0.5 0.0566117 2 -1.5 -1.5 -0.5 0.2119416 3 0.0 -1.5 -0.5 0.5465494 4 1.5 -1.5 -0.5 0.8437947 5 3.0 -1.5 -0.5 0.9603322 tibble( case = 6:11, vda = 0.0, vsr = c(-1.5, -1.5, -1.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5), vtr = c(-1.5, -1.0, -0.5, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5) ) %&gt;% mutate( p = exp(vda) / (exp(vda) + exp(vsr) + exp(vtr)) ) %&gt;% kableExtra::kbl( caption = &quot;Probability Values for Drive Alone as a Function of Shared Ride and Transit Utilties&quot;, col.names = c(&quot;$Case$&quot;, &quot;$V_{DA}$&quot;, &quot;$V_{SR}$&quot;, &quot;$V_{TR}$&quot;, &quot;$Pr(DA)$&quot;)) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling() Table 4.2: Probability Values for Drive Alone as a Function of Shared Ride and Transit Utilties \\(Case\\) \\(V_{DA}\\) \\(V_{SR}\\) \\(V_{TR}\\) \\(Pr(DA)\\) 6 0 -1.5 -1.5 0.6914385 7 0 -1.5 -1.0 0.6285317 8 0 -1.5 -0.5 0.5465494 9 0 -0.5 -1.5 0.5465494 10 0 -0.5 -1.0 0.5064804 11 0 -0.5 -0.5 0.4518628 We use this three-alternative example to illustrate three important properties of the MNL: (1) its sigmoid or S shape, (2) dependence of the alternative choice probabilities on the differences in the systematic utility and (3) independence of the ratio of the choice probabilities of any pair of alternatives from the attributes and availability of other alternatives. 4.1.1 The Sigmoid or S shape of Multinomial Logit Probabilities The S shape of the MNL probabilities is illustrated in Figure ?? where the probability of choosing Drive Alone is shown as a function of its own utility, with the utilities of the other alternatives held constant. The S-shape limits the probability range between zero when the utility of DA is very low, relative to other alternatives, and one when the utility of DA is very high, relative to other alternatives. This function has very gradual slope at extreme values of DA utility, relative to the other alternatives, and is much steeper when its utility reaches a value such that its choice probability is close to one-half. This implies that if the representative utility of one alternative is very low or very high, compared with the others, a small increase in the utility of this alternative will not substantially affect its probability of being chosen. The point at which an increase in the representative utility of an alternative has the greatest effect on its probability of being chosen (i.e., the point of maximum slope along the curve) is when its representative utility is equivalent to the combined utility of the other alternatives. When this is true, a small increase in the utility of one alternative can ‘tip the balance’ and induce a large increase in the probability of the alternative being chosen (Train, 1993). #&#39; Function to compute mnl probabilities #&#39; @param vi utility of target alternative #&#39; @param ... utilities of other alternatives mnl_prob &lt;- function(vi, ...){ vj &lt;- c(...) exp(vi) / sum(exp(vj)) } u &lt;- tibble( v_da = seq(-3, 3, by = 0.01), v_tr = 0, v_walk = -0.5 ) %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate( drive = mnl_prob(v_da, v_da, v_tr, v_walk), transit = mnl_prob(v_tr, v_da, v_tr, v_walk), walk = mnl_prob(v_walk, v_da, v_tr, v_walk) ) ggplot(u %&gt;% gather(Mode, Probability, drive, transit, walk), aes(x = v_da, y = Probability, color = Mode)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Utility of Drive&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 4.4: Probability of choosing alternatives while holding other utilities constant, \\(V_{transit} = 0, V_{walk} = -0.5\\) 4.1.2 The Equivalent Differences Property A fundamental property of the multinomial logit and other choice models is that the choice probabilities of the alternatives depend only on the differences in the systematic utilities of different alternatives and not their actual values. This can be illustrated in two ways. First, we show that the choice probability equations are unchanged if the same incremental value, say \\(\\Delta V\\), is added to the utility of each alternative. The original probabilities for the three alternatives in the example are given by: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(i) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{i})}{\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})} \\tag{4.11} \\end{equation}\\] where i is the alternative for which the probabilities are being computed. Adding \\(\\Delta V\\) to the systematic components of \\(V_{DA}\\), \\(V_{SR}\\) and \\(V_{TR}\\) gives3: \\[\\begin{align*} Pr(i)&amp;= \\frac{\\exp(V_i + {\\Delta V })} {\\exp(V_{DA}+{\\Delta V }) + \\exp(V_{SR}+{\\Delta V }) + \\exp(V_{TR}+{\\Delta V })} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\exp(V_i) \\times \\exp({\\Delta V })} {\\exp(V_{DA}) \\times \\exp({\\Delta V }) + \\exp(V_{SR}) \\times \\exp({\\Delta V }) + \\exp(V_{TR}) \\times \\exp({\\Delta V })} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\exp(V_i) \\times \\exp({\\Delta V })}{[\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})] \\times \\exp({\\Delta V })} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\exp(V_i)}{[\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})]} \\tag{4.12} \\end{align*}\\] which is the same probability as before \\(\\Delta V\\) was added to each of the utilities. This result applies to any value of \\(\\Delta V\\). We also illustrate this property through use of a numerical example for the three alternative choice problem used earlier. The following equations represent the case when the utility values for Drive Alone, Shared Ride and Transit equal 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0, respectively: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(DA) = \\frac {\\exp(-0.5)}{\\exp(-0.5) + \\exp(-1.5) + \\exp(-3.0)} = 0.690 \\tag{4.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(SR) = \\frac {\\exp(-1.5)}{\\exp(-0.5) + \\exp(-1.5) + \\exp(-3.0)} = 0.254 \\tag{4.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(TR) = \\frac {\\exp(-3.0)}{\\exp(-0.5) + \\exp(-1.5) + \\exp(-3.0)} = 0.057 \\tag{4.15} \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, if the utility of each alternative is increased by one, the probabilities are: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(DA) = \\frac {\\exp(0.5)}{\\exp(0.5) + \\exp(-0.5) + \\exp(-2.0)} = 0.690 \\tag{4.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(SR) = \\frac {\\exp(-0.5)}{\\exp(0.5) + \\exp(-0.5) + \\exp(-2.0)} = 0.254 \\tag{4.17} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(TR) = \\frac {\\exp(-2.0)}{\\exp(0.5) + \\exp(-0.5) + \\exp(-2.0)} = 0.057 \\tag{4.18} \\end{equation}\\] As expected, the choice probabilities are identical to those obtained before the addition of the constant utility to each mode. The calculations supporting this comparison are shown in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4. Table 4.3 shows the computation of the choice probabilities based on the initial set of modal utilities and Table 4.4 shows the same computation after each of the utilities is increased by one.4 Table 4.3: Numerical Example Illustrating Equivalent Difference Property: Probability of Each Alternative Before Adding Delta Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone -0.50 -0.5 0.6065307 0.6896721 Shared Ride -1.50 -1.5 0.2231302 0.2537162 Transit -3.00 -3.0 0.0497871 0.0566117 Total NA 0.8794479 1.0000000 where the sum of the exponent variable is equal to 0.879.

For the drive alone alternative, this expression can be obtained by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard probability expression by (-VDA) as shown in the following equations. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} Pr(DA) &amp;= \\frac{\\exp(V_{DA})}{\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})} \\times \\frac {\\exp(-V_{DA})}{\\exp(-V_{DA})}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac {\\exp(V_{DA})\\times \\exp(-V_{DA})}{[\\exp(V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{SR}) + \\exp(V_{TR})] \\times \\exp(-V_{DA})}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac {\\exp(0)}{\\exp(0) + \\exp(V_{SR}-V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{TR}-V_{DA})} \\end{split} \\tag{4.19} \\end{equation}\\] which simplifies to: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(i) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(0) + \\exp(V_{SR}-V_{DA}) + \\exp(V_{TR}-V_{DA})} \\tag{4.20} \\end{equation}\\] This formulation explicitly shows that the probability of the drive alone alternative is a function of the differences in systematic utility between the drive alone alternative and each other alternative. This can be applied to the general case for alternative \\(i\\) which can be represented in terms of the pairwise difference in its utility and the utility of each of the other alternatives by the following equation: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(i) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{j \\ne i}\\exp(V_j - V_i)} \\qquad \\forall i \\in J \\tag{4.21} \\end{equation}\\] 4.1.2.1 Implication of Constant Differences for Alternative Specific Constants and Variables The constant difference property of logit models has an important implication for the specification of the utilities of the alternatives. Recall that the systematic portion of the utility of an individual, ‘\\(t\\)’, and alternative ‘\\(i\\)’ is the sum of decision-maker related bias, mode attribute related utility, and interactions between these. That is: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{DA} = V_{DA}(S_t) + V(X_{DA}) + V(S_t,X_{DA}) \\tag{4.22} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{SR} = V_{SR}(S_t) + V(X_{SR}) + V(S_t,X_{SR}) \\tag{4.23} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{TR} = V_{TR}(S_t) + V(X_{TR}) + V(S_t,X_{TR}) \\tag{4.24} \\end{equation}\\] Each term on the right hand side of each equation can be replaced by an explicit function of the relevant variables. For example, if the decision-maker preferences are a function of income, attribute based utility is a function of travel time and there are no interaction terms, the utility function becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{DA} = \\beta_{DA,0} + \\beta_{DA,1} \\times Income_t + \\gamma \\times TT_{DA} \\tag{4.25} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{SR} = \\beta_{SR,0} + \\beta_{SR,1} \\times Income_t + \\gamma \\times TT_{SR} \\tag{4.26} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{TR} = \\beta_{TR,0} + \\beta_{TR,1} \\times Income_t + \\gamma \\times TT_{TR} \\tag{4.27} \\end{equation}\\] and the differences between pairs of alternatives for prediction of DA probability become: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} V_{SR} - V_{DA} = (\\beta_{SR,0} - \\beta_{DA,0}) + \\beta_{SR,1} - \\beta_{DA,1})\\\\ \\times Income_t + \\gamma \\times (TT_{SR} - TT_{DA}) \\end{split} \\tag{4.28} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} V_{TR} - V_{DA} = (\\beta_{TR,0} - \\beta_{DA,0}) + \\beta_{TR,1} - \\beta_{DA,1})\\\\ \\times Income_t + \\gamma \\times (TT_{TR} - TT_{TA}) \\end{split} \\tag{4.29} \\end{equation}\\] It is not possible to estimate all of the constants; \\(\\beta_{DA,0}\\), \\(\\beta_{SR,0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{TR,0}\\); and all of the income parameters; \\(\\beta_{DA,1}\\), \\(\\beta_{SR,1}\\) and \\(\\beta_{TR,1}\\); in these equations because adding any algebraic value to each of the constants or to each of the income parameters does not cause any change in the probabilities of any of the alternatives. This phenomenon is common to all utility-based choice models and follows directly from the equivalent differences property discussed above. The solution to this problem is to place a single constraint on each set of parameters; in this case, the constants and the income parameters. Any constraint can be adopted for each set of parameters; however, the simplest and most widely used is to set the preference related parameters for one alternative, called the base or reference alternative, to zero and to re-interpret the remaining parameters to represent preference differences relative to the base alternative. The selection of the reference alternative is arbitrary and does not affect the overall quality or interpretation of the model; however, the equations and the estimation results will appear to be different. For example, if we set TRansit as the reference alternative by setting \\(\\beta_{TR,0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{TR,1}\\) equal to zero, the utility functions become: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{DA,t} = \\beta_{DA-TR,0} + \\beta_{DA-TR,1} \\times Inc_t + \\gamma \\times TT_{DA} \\tag{4.30} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{SR,t} = \\beta_{SR-TR,0} + \\beta_{SR-TR,1} \\times Inc_t + \\gamma \\times TT_{SR} \\tag{4.31} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{TR,t} = \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad 0 \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad + \\gamma \\times TT_{TR} \\tag{4.32} \\end{equation}\\] where the modified notation for the remaining constants and income parameters is used to emphasize that these parameters are ‘relative to the TRansit alternative.’ Alternatively, if we select Drive Alone as the reference alternative, we obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{DA,t} = \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad 0 \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad + \\gamma \\times TT_{DA} \\tag{4.33} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{SR,t} = \\beta_{SR-DA,0} + \\beta_{SR-DA,1} \\times Inc_t + \\gamma \\times TT_{SR} \\tag{4.34} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{TR,t} = \\beta_{TR-DA,0} + \\beta_{TR-DA,1} \\times Inc_t + \\gamma \\times TT_{TR} \\tag{4.35} \\end{equation}\\] where the constants and income parameters are relative to the Drive Alone alternative. These two models are equivalent as shown in Table ?? and Table ?? which correspond to the TRansit reference and Drive Alone reference examples, respectively, for an individual from a household with $50,000 annual income and facing travel times of 30, 35 and 50 minutes for Drive Alone, Shared Ride and TRansit, respectively. utility_table( c(&quot;Drive Alone&quot; = &quot;1.1 + 0.008 * 50 - 0.02 * 30&quot;, &quot;Shared Ride&quot; = &quot;0.8 + 0.006 * 50 - 0.02 * 35&quot;, &quot;Transit&quot; = &quot;0.0 + 0.000 * 50 - 0.02 * 50&quot;) ) %&gt;% kableExtra::kbl(caption = &quot;Utility and Probability calculation with TRansit as Base Alternative&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot;=1, &quot;Utility&quot; = 2, &quot; &quot; = 2), align = &quot;center&quot;) Table 4.5: Utility and Probability calculation with TRansit as Base Alternative Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone 1.1 + 0.008 * 50 - 0.02 * 30 0.9 2.4596031 0.5694439 Shared Ride 0.8 + 0.006 * 50 - 0.02 * 35 0.4 1.4918247 0.3453852 Transit 0.0 + 0.000 * 50 - 0.02 * 50 -1.0 0.3678794 0.0851709 Total NA 4.3193072 1.0000000 where the sum of the exponent variable equals 4.319. utility_table( c( &quot;Drive Alone&quot; = &quot;0.0 + 0.000 * 50 - 0.02 * 30&quot;, &quot;Shared Ride&quot; = &quot;-0.3 - 0.002 * 50 - 0.02 * 35&quot;, &quot;Transit&quot; = &quot;-1.1 - 0.008 * 50 - 0.02 * 50&quot;) ) %&gt;% kableExtra::kbl(caption = &quot;Utility and Probability calculation with TRansit as Base Alternative&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot;=1, &quot;Utility&quot; = 2, &quot; &quot; = 2), align = &quot;center&quot;) Table 4.6: Utility and Probability calculation with TRansit as Base Alternative Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone 0.0 + 0.000 * 50 - 0.02 * 30 -0.6 0.5488116 0.5694439 Shared Ride -0.3 - 0.002 * 50 - 0.02 * 35 -1.1 0.3328711 0.3453852 Transit -1.1 - 0.008 * 50 - 0.02 * 50 -2.5 0.0820850 0.0851709 Total NA 0.9637677 1.0000000 where the sum of the exponent variable equals 0.964.

The IIA property states that for any individual, the ratio of the probabilities of choosing two alternatives is independent of the presence or attributes of any other alternative. The premise is that other alternatives are irrelevant to the decision of choosing between the two alternatives in the pair. To illustrate this, consider a multinomial logit model for the choice among three intercity travel modes – automobile, rail, and bus. The probability of choosing automobile, rail and bus are: \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(Auto) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{Auto})}{\\exp(V_{Auto})+\\exp(V_{Bus})+\\exp(V_{Rail})} \\tag{4.36} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(Bus) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{Bus})}{\\exp(V_{Auto})+\\exp(V_{Bus})+\\exp(V_{Rail})} \\tag{4.37} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} Pr(Rail) = \\frac{\\exp(V_{Rail})}{\\exp(V_{Auto})+\\exp(V_{Bus})+\\exp(V_{Rail})} \\tag{4.38} \\end{equation}\\] The ratios of each pair of probabilities are: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{Pr(Auto)}{Pr(Bus)} = \\frac{\\exp(V_{Auto})}{\\exp(V_{Bus})} = \\exp(V_{Auto} - V_{Bus}) \\tag{4.39} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{Pr(Auto)}{Pr(Rail)} = \\frac{\\exp(V_{Auto})}{\\exp(V_{Rail})} = \\exp(V_{Auto} - V_{Rail}) \\tag{4.40} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{Pr(Bus)}{Pr(Rail)} = \\frac{\\exp(V_{Bus})}{\\exp(V_{Rail})} = \\exp(V_{Bus} - V_{Rail}) \\tag{4.41} \\end{equation}\\] The ratios of probabilities for each pair of alternatives depend only on the attributes of those alternatives and not on the attributes of the third alternative and would remain the same regardless of whether that third alternative is available or not. This formulation can be generalized to any pair of alternatives by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{Pr(i)}{Pr(k)} = \\frac{\\exp(V_i)}{\\exp(V_k)} = \\exp(V_i - V_k) \\tag{4.42} \\end{equation}\\] which, as before, is independent of the number or attributes of other alternatives in the choice set. The IIA property has some important ramifications in the formulation, estimation and use of multinomial logit models. The independence of irrelevant alternatives property allows the addition or removal of an alternative from the choice set without affecting the structure or parameters of the model. The flexibility of applying the model to cases with different choice sets has a number of advantages. First, the model can be estimated and applied in cases where different members of the population (and sample) face different sets of alternatives. For example, in the case of intercity mode choice, individuals traveling between some city pairs may not have air service and/or rail service. Second, this property simplifies the estimation of the parameters in the multinomial logit model (as will be discussed later). Third, this property is advantageous when applying a model to the prediction of choice probabilities for a new alternative. On the other hand, the IIA property may not properly reflect the behavioral relationships among groups of alternatives. That is, other alternatives may not be irrelevant to the ratio of probabilities between a pair of alternatives. In some cases, this will result in erroneous predictions of choice probabilities. An extreme example of this problem is the classic “red bus/blue bus paradox.” 4.2.1 The Red Bus/Blue Bus Paradox Consider the case of a commuter who has a choice of going to work by auto or taking a blue bus. Assume that the attributes of the auto and the blue bus are such that the probability of choosing auto is two-thirds and blue bus is one-third so the ratio of their choice probabilities is 2:1. Now suppose that a competing bus operator introduces red bus service (the bus is painted red, rather than blue) on the same route, operating the same vehicle type, using the same schedule and serving the same stops as the blue bus service. Thus, the only difference between the red and blue bus services is the color of the buses. The most reasonable expectation, in this case, is that the same share of people will choose auto and bus and that the bus riders will split equally between the red and blue bus services. That is, the addition of the red bus to the commuters’ choice set should have no, or very little, effect on the share of commuters choosing auto since this change does not affect the relative quality of drive alone and bus. Therefore, we expect choice probabilities following the initiation of red bus service to be auto, two-thirds; blue bus, one-sixth and red bus, one-sixth. However, due to the IIA property, the multinomial logit model will maintain the relative probability of auto and blue bus as 2:1. If we assume that people are indifferent to color of their transit vehicle, the two bus services will have the same representative utility and consequently, their relative probabilities will be 1:1 and the share probabilities for the three alternatives will be: Pr(Auto) = ½, Pr(Blue Bus) = 1/4, and Pr(Red Bus) = 1/4. That is, the probability (share) of people choosing auto will decline from two-thirds to one half as a result of introducing an alternative which is identical to an existing alternative5. The red bus/blue bus paradox provides an important illustration of the possible consequences of the IIA property. Although this is an extreme case; the IIA property can be a problem in other, less extreme cases. 4.3 Example: Prediction with Multinomial Logit Model We illustrate the application of multinomial logit models with different specifications in the context of mode choice analysis. Consider a commute trip by an individual who has three available modes in the choice set: drive alone, carpool, and bus. The examples in this section illustrate the manner in which different utility specifications and the estimated parameters associated with them are used to predict choice probabilities based on characteristics of the traveler (decision-maker) and attributes of the alternatives. These examples progress from the simplest models to moderately complex models. Example 1 – Constants Only Model The simplest specification of the multinomial logit model is the ‘constants only’ model, in which the utility of each alternative has a fixed value for all decision-makers. Typically, the alternative specific constants are considered to represent the average effect of all factors that influence the choice but are not included in the utility specification. For example, factors such as comfort, safety, privacy and reliability may be excluded due to the difficulty associated with their measurement. In the constants only model, it is implicitly assumed that the constants reflect the average effects of all the variables affecting the choice decision, since no variables are included explicitly in the utility specification. If these constants are 0.0, -1.6 and -1.8 for drive alone, shared ride and transit, respectively, the probability calculation is as shown in Table 4.8. Table 4.8: MNL Properties for Constants Only Model Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone 0.0 0.0 1.0000000 0.7314243 Shared Ride -1.60 -1.6 0.2018965 0.1476720 Transit -1.80 -1.8 0.1652989 0.1209036 Total NA 1.3671954 1.0000000 As expected, Drive Alone has the highest probability, followed by Shared Ride, and TRansit. Example 2 – Including Mode Related Variables - Travel Time and Travel Cost Two key attributes that influence choice of mode are travel time and travel cost. We include these variables in the deterministic component of the utility function of each mode with the parameter for time (in minutes) equal to -0.045 and for cost (in cents) equal to -0.004 for all three modes, Table 4.9. This implies that a minute of travel time (or a cent of cost) has the same marginal disutility regardless of the mode; such variables are referred to as generic variables. The negative signs of the travel time and travel cost coefficients imply that the utility of a mode and the probability that it will be chosen decreases as the travel time or travel cost of that mode increases. Positive coefficients would be inconsistent with our understanding of travel behavior and therefore any specification which results in a positive sign for travel time or travel cost should be rejected. Such counter-intuitive results are most likely due to an incorrect or inadequate model specification; however, it is possible that the data from any particular sample leads to such counter-intuitive results. The inclusion of travel time and travel cost variables induces a change in the alternative specific constants, to -1.865 for shared ride and -0.650 for transit, as the effect of excluding these time and cost variables is removed from the constants. Such changes in alternative specific constants, as a result of the introduction of new variables or the elimination of included variables preserve the sample shares6 and are expected. To illustrate the application of the multinomial logit model for the above utility equation, we assume travel time and travel cost values as follows: Mode Travel Time Travel Cost Drive Alone 25 minutes $1.75 Shared Ride 28 minutes $0.75 TRansit 55 minutes $1.25 The utilities and probabilities are calculated as shown in Table 4.9. utility_table( c(&quot;Drive Alone&quot; = &quot;-0.045*25-0.004*175&quot;, &quot;Shared Ride&quot; = &quot;-1.865-0.045*28-0.004*75&quot;, &quot;Transit&quot; = &quot;-0.650-0.045*55-0.004*125&quot;) ) %&gt;% kbl(caption = &quot;MNL Probabilities for Time and Cost Model&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot; = 1, &quot;Utility&quot;= 2, &quot; &quot; = 2), align = &quot;center&quot;) Table 4.9: MNL Probabilities for Time and Cost Model Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone -0.04525-0.004175 -1.825 0.1612176 0.7314243 Shared Ride -1.865-0.04528-0.00475 -3.425 0.0325493 0.1476720 Transit -0.650-0.04555-0.004125 -3.625 0.0266491 0.1209036 Total NA 0.2204160 1.0000000 This specification can be refined further by decomposing travel time into its two major components: (1) in-vehicle travel time, and (2) out-of-vehicle travel time. In-vehicle time (IVT) is defined as the time spent inside the vehicle, and out-of-vehicle time (OVT) is the time not spent inside the vehicle (including access time, waiting time, and egress time). There is an abundance of empirical evidence that travelers are much more sensitive to out-of-vehicle time than to in-vehicle time and therefore a minute of out-of-vehicle time will generate a higher disutility than a minute of in-vehicle time. This will be reflected in the modal utilities by a larger negative coefficient on out-of-vehicle time than on in-vehicle time. Introduction of this refinement will usually result in a less negative parameter for in vehicle time and a more negative parameter for out of vehicle time than for total time; say -0.031 and -0.062, respectively. If the travel times are split as follows: Mode IVT OVT Travel Cost Drive Alone 21 minutes 4 minutes $1.75 Shared Ride 23 minutes 5 minutes $0.75 Bus 25 minutes 30 minutes $1.25 the new systematic utilities and choice probabilities are as computed in Table 4.10: utility_table( c(&quot;Drive Alone&quot; = &quot;-0.031*21-0.062*4-0.004*175&quot;, &quot;Shared Ride&quot; = &quot;-1.90-0.031*23-0.062*5-0.004*75&quot;, &quot;Transit&quot; = &quot;-0.80-0.031*25-0.062*30-0.004*125&quot;) ) %&gt;% kbl(caption = &quot;MNL Probabilities for Time and Cost Model&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot; = 1, &quot;Utility&quot;= 2, &quot; &quot; = 2), align = &quot;center&quot;) Table 4.10: MNL Probabilities for Time and Cost Model Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone -0.03121-0.0624-0.004*175 -1.599 0.2020985 0.7729036 Shared Ride -1.90-0.03123-0.0625-0.004*75 -3.223 0.0398354 0.1523460 Transit -0.80-0.03125-0.06230-0.004*125 -3.935 0.0195457 0.0747504 Total NA 0.2614796 1.0000000 Example 3 – Including Decision-Maker Related Biases - Income The preceding examples do not include any characteristics of the traveler in the modal utilities. However, we know that choice probabilities of the available modes also depend on characteristics of the traveler, such as his/her income. Economic theory and empirical evidence suggests that higher income travelers are less likely to choose transit than drive alone or carpool. We can incorporate this behavior in the model by including an alternative specific income variable in the utility of up to two of the alternatives; in this case, we include income in the transit alternative with a negative coefficient. That is, everything else held constant, the utility of transit decreases as the income of the traveler increases. Consequently, a higher income traveler will have a lower probability of choosing transit than a lower income traveler. The absence of an alternative specific parameter for the carpool alternative implies that the choice of carpool, relative to drive alone, is unaffected by a traveler’s income. The alternative specific constant of the transit utility changes substantially from the preceding example as it no longer reflects the average effect of excluding income from the transit utility specification. The calculation of utilities and probabilities for this model for a person from a household with $50,000 annual income is shown in 4.11. utility_table( c(&quot;Drive Alone&quot; = &quot; -0.031*21-0.062*4-0.004*175&quot;, &quot;Shared Ride&quot; = &quot;-1.90-0.031*23-0.062*5-0.004*75&quot;, &quot;Transit&quot; = &quot;-0.50-0.031*25-0.062*30-0.004*125-0.0087*50&quot;) ) %&gt;% kbl(caption = &quot;MNL Probabilities for In and Out of Vehicle Time, Cost and Income Model&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot; = 1, &quot;Utility&quot;= 2, &quot; &quot; = 2), align = &quot;center&quot;) Table 4.11: MNL Probabilities for In and Out of Vehicle Time, Cost and Income Model Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone -0.03121-0.0624-0.004*175 -1.599 0.2020985 0.7802692 Shared Ride -1.90-0.03123-0.0625-0.004*75 -3.223 0.0398354 0.1537978 Transit -0.50-0.03125-0.06230-0.004125-0.008750 -4.070 0.0170774 0.0659330 Total NA 0.2590113 1.0000000 The probability of choosing transit is smaller for this traveler than would have been predicted using the model reported in the preceding example. This model will give decreasing transit probabilities for higher income travelers and increasing transit probabilities for lower income travelers. That is, the lower the traveler’s income, the greater his/her probability of choosing the least expensive mode of travel (transit), an intuitive and reasonable result. Example 4 – Interaction of Mode Attributes and Decision-Maker Related Biases An alternative method of including income in the utility specification is to use income as a deflator of cost by forming a variable by dividing cost by income. This formulation reflects the rationale that cost becomes a less important factor in the choice of a travel mode as the income of the traveler increases. The revised utility functions and calculations are shown in Table 4.12 using the values for the modal attributes and income as used in preceding example. utility_table( c(&quot;Drive Alone&quot; = &quot; -0.031*21-0.062*4-0.153*(175/50) &quot;, &quot;Shared Ride&quot; = &quot; -1.90-0.031*23-0.062*5-0.153*(75/50) &quot;, &quot;Transit&quot; = &quot;-0.45-0.031*25-0.062*30-0.153*(125/50)&quot;) ) %&gt;% kbl(caption = &quot;MNL Probabilities for In and Out of Vehicle Time, Cost/Income Model&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot; = 1, &quot;Utility&quot;= 2, &quot; &quot; = 2), align = &quot;center&quot;) Table 4.12: MNL Probabilities for In and Out of Vehicle Time, Cost/Income Model Utility Alternative Expression Value Exponent Probability Drive Alone -0.03121-0.0624-0.153*(175/50) -1.4345 0.2382345 0.7631451 Shared Ride -1.90-0.03123-0.0625-0.153*(75/50) -3.1525 0.0427451 0.1369270 Transit -0.45-0.03125-0.06230-0.153*(125/50) -3.4675 0.0311949 0.0999278 Total NA 0.3121745 1.0000000 This specification of income in the utility function also results in lower income travelers predicted to have higher probability of choosing transit; it also suggests that such travelers will increase their probability of choosing carpool, the least expensive mode. The reader should compute the probabilities for different income values and verify the response pattern. 4.4 Measures of Response to Changes in Attributes of Alternatives Choice probabilities in logit models are a function of the values of the attributes that define the utility of the alternatives; therefore, it is useful to know the extent to which the probabilities change in response to changes in the value of those attributes. For example, in a traveler’s mode choice decision, an important question is to what extent the probability of choosing a mode (rail, for example) will decrease/increase, if the fares of that mode are increased by a certain amount. Similarly, a transit agency may want to know the gain in ridership that is likely to occur in response to service improvements (increased frequency). This section describes various aspects of understanding and quantifying the response to changes in attributes of alternatives. 4.4.1 Derivatives of Choice Probabilities One measure for evaluating the response to changes is to calculate the derivatives of the choice probabilities of each alternative with respect to the variable in question. Usually, one is concerned about the change in probability of an alternative, \\(P_i\\), with respect to the change in attributes of that alternative \\(X_i\\). This measure, the direct derivative, is computed by differentiating \\(P_i\\) with respect to \\(X_{ik}\\), the \\(k^{th}\\) attribute of alternative \\(i\\). The mathematical expression for the direct derivative of \\(P_i\\) with respect to \\(X_{ik}\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial P_{i}}{\\partial X_{ik}} = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial V_{i}}{\\partial X_{ik}} \\times (P_{i}) \\times (1-P_{i}) \\tag{4.43} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(V_i\\) is the utility of the alternative.7 Typically the utility function is specified to be linear in parameters; that is: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_{1i} + \\beta_{2}X_{2i} + \\cdots + \\beta_{k}X_{ki} + \\cdots + \\beta_{K}X_{Ki} \\tag{4.44} \\end{equation}\\] In this case, the expression for the direct derivative of \\(P_i\\) with respect to \\(X_{ik}\\) reduces to: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial P_{i}}{\\partial X_{ki}} = \\beta_{k} \\times (P_{i}) \\times (1-P_{i}) \\tag{4.45} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{k}\\) is the coefficient of attribute \\(k\\). The value of the derivative is largest at \\(P_{i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and becomes smaller as \\(P_{i}\\) approaches zero or one. This implies that the magnitude of the response to a change in an attribute will be greatest when the choice probability for the alternative under consideration is 0.5 and this response diminishes as the probability approaches zero or one. The direct derivative is simply the slope of the logit model probability curve illustrated in Figure 4.4 and that its mathematical properties are consistent with the qualitative discussion of the S-shape of the logit probability curve in section 4.1.1. The sign of the derivative is the same as the sign of the parameter describing the impact of \\(X_{ik}\\) in the utility of alternative \\(i\\). Thus, an increase in \\(X_{ik}\\) will increase (decrease) \\(P_{i}\\) if \\(\\beta_{ik}\\) is positive (negative). Often it is important to understand how the choice probability of other alternatives changes in response to a given change in the attribute level of the action alternative. This measure, termed the \\(cross\\) \\(derivative\\), is obtained by computing the derivative of the choice probability of an alternative,\\(P_{j}\\) , with respect to the attribute of the changed alternative, \\(X_{ik}\\). This \\(cross\\) \\(derivative\\) for linear utility functions is:8 \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial P_{i}}{\\partial X_{ki}} = \\beta_{k} \\times (P_{i}) \\times (1-P_{j}) \\tag{4.46} \\end{equation}\\] Often it is important to understand how the choice probability of other alternatives changes in response to a given change in the attribute level of the action alternative. This measure, termed the cross derivative, is obtained by computing the derivative of the choice probability of an alternative, \\(P_j\\), with respect to the attribute of the changed alternative, \\(X_{ik}\\). This cross derivative for linear utility functions is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial P_{j}}{\\partial X_{ik}} = \\beta_{k} \\times (P_{i}) \\times (P_{j}) \\forall_{i} \\ne j \\tag{4.47} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta_{jk}\\) is the coefficient of the \\(k^{th}\\) attribute of alternative \\(j\\), \\(P_{i}\\) is the probability of alternative \\(i\\), and \\(P_{j}\\) is the probability of alternative \\(j\\). In this case, the sign of the derivative is opposite to the sign of the parameter describing the impact of \\(X_{ik}\\) on the utility of alternative \\(i\\). Thus an increase in \\(X_{ik}\\) will decrease (increase) the probability of choosing alternative, \\(P_{i}\\), if the parameter \\(\\beta_{k}\\) is positive (negative). In this case, the sign of the derivative is opposite to the sign of the parameter describing the impact of \\(X_{ik}\\) on the utility of alternative \\(i\\). Thus an increase in \\(X_{ik}\\) will decrease (increase) the probability of choosing alternative, \\(P_j\\), if the parameter \\(\\beta_k\\) is positive (negative). It is useful to recognize that the sum of the derivatives over all the alternatives must be equal to zero. That is, \\[\\begin{align} \\sum_{\\forall_{j}}\\frac{\\partial P_{j}}{\\partial X_{ik}}&amp;= \\frac{\\partial P_{j}}{\\partial X_{ik}} + \\sum_{\\forall_{j \\ne i}}\\frac{\\partial P_{j}}{\\partial X_{ik}}\\\\ &amp;= \\beta_{k}P_{i}(1-P_{i}) - \\sum_{\\forall_{j \\ne i}}\\beta_{k}P_{i}P_{j}\\\\ &amp;= \\beta_{k}P_{i}(1-P_{i}) - \\beta_{k}P_{i}\\sum_{\\forall_{j \\ne i}}P_{j}\\\\ &amp;= \\beta_{k}P_{i}(1-P_{i}) - \\beta_{k}P_{i}(1-P_{i})\\\\ &amp;= 0 \\tag{4.48} \\end{align}\\] This is as expected. Since the sum of all probabilities is fixed at one, the sum of the derivatives of the probability due to a change in any attribute of any alternative must be equal to zero. 4.4.2 Elasticities of Choice Probabilities Elasticity is another measure that is used to quantify the extent to which the choice probabilities of each alternative will change in response to the changes in the value of an attribute. In general, elasticity is defined as the percentage change in the response variable with respect to a one percent change in an explanatory variable. In the context of logit models, the response variable is the choice probability of an alternative, such as \\(P_i\\), and the explanatory variable is the attribute \\(X_{ik}\\). Elasticities are different from derivatives in that elasticities are normalized by the variable units. To clearly illustrate the concept of elasticity, let us consider that \\(P_{i1}\\) and \\(P_{i2}\\) are choice probabilities of an alternative \\(i\\) at attribute levels \\(X_{i1}\\) and \\(X_{i2}\\), respectively. In this case, the elasticity is the proportional change in the probability divided by the proportional change in the attribute under consideration: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{\\text{Pct Change in Probability}}{\\text{Pct Change in Variable}} = \\frac{(P_{2}-P_{1})/P_{1}}{(X_{2}-X_{1})/X_{1}} = \\frac{\\Delta P/P_{1}}{\\Delta X/X_{1}} \\tag{4.49} \\end{equation}\\] There is some ambiguity in the computation of this elasticity measure in terms of whether it should be normalized using the original probability-attribute combination (\\(P_{i1}\\), \\(X_{i1}\\) ) or the new probability-attribute combination (\\(P_{i2}\\), \\(X_{i2}\\)). A compromise approach is to compute the elasticity relative to the mid-point of both sets of variables, yielding a measure called the arc elasticity. The expression for arc elasticity is: There is some ambiguity in the computation of this elasticity measure in terms of whether it should be normalized using the original probability-attribute combination (\\(P_{i1}\\), \\(X_{i1}\\)) or the new probability-attribute combination (\\(P_{i2}\\), \\(X_{i2}\\)). A compromise approach is to compute the elasticity relative to the mid-point of both sets of variables, yielding a measure called the arc elasticity. The expression for arc elasticity is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle Arc Elasticity = \\frac{\\Bigg(\\frac{(P_{2}-P_{1})}{(P_{1}+P_{2})/2)}\\Bigg)}{\\Bigg(\\frac{(X_{2}-X_{1})}{(X_{1}+X_{2})/2)}\\Bigg)} = \\frac{\\Bigg(\\frac{(\\Delta P)}{(P_{1}+P_{2})/2)}\\Bigg)}{\\Bigg(\\frac{(\\Delta X)}{(X_{1}+X_{2})/2)}\\Bigg)} \\tag{4.50} \\end{equation}\\] Estimates of elasticity will differ depending on whether the normalization is at the start value, final value or mid-point values. This confusion can be avoided by computing elasticities for \\(\\underline{very\\ small}\\) changes. When the elasticity is computed for infinitesimally small changes, the elasticity obtained is termed the point elasticity. The expression for point elasticity is given as a function of the derivatives discussed earlier (section 4.4.1): \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\eta_{X}^{P} = \\frac{\\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial P}{P}\\Bigg)}{\\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial X}{X}\\Bigg)} = \\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial X}\\Bigg) \\times \\Bigg(\\frac{X}{P}\\Bigg) \\tag{4.51} \\end{equation}\\] Estimates of elasticity will differ depending on whether the normalization is at the start value, final value or mid-point values. This confusion can be avoided by computing elasticities for very small changes. When the elasticity is computed for infinitesimally small changes, the elasticity obtained is termed the point elasticity. The expression for point elasticity is given as a function of the derivatives discussed earlier (section 4.4.1): \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\eta_{X_{ik}}^{P_{i}} = \\frac{\\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial P_{i}}{P}\\Bigg)}{\\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial X_{ik}}{X_{ik}}\\Bigg)} = \\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial P_{i}}{\\partial X_{ik}}\\Bigg) \\times \\Bigg(\\frac{X_{ik}}{P_{i}}\\Bigg) \\tag{4.52} \\end{equation}\\] We are interested in both direct- and cross-elasticities corresponding to the direct- and cross-derivatives discussed above. The direct elasticity measures the percent change in the choice probability of alternative, \\(P_i\\) with respect to a percent change in the attribute level (\\(X_{ik}\\)) of that alternative: We can substitute equation 4.45 into 4.51 to obtain the following expression for the direct elasticity \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\eta_{X_{ik}}^{P_{i}} = \\beta_{k}P_{i}(1-P_{i})\\Bigg(\\frac{X_{ik}}{P_{i}}\\Bigg) = \\beta_{k}X_{ik}(1-P_{i}) \\tag{4.53} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the direct elasticity is not only a function of the parameter value, \\(\\beta_{k}\\), for the attribute in the utility, but is also a function of the attribute level, \\(X_{ik}\\), at which the elasticity is being computed. Thus, the direct elasticity is not only a function of the parameter value, \\(\\beta_k\\), for the attribute in the utility, but is also a function of the attribute level, \\(X_{ik}\\), at which the elasticity is being computed. Similarly, the cross-elasticity is defined as the proportional change in the choice probability of an alternative (\\(P_j\\)) with respect to a proportional change in some attribute of another alternative (\\(X_{ik}\\)). The expression for cross elasticity in a multinomial logit model is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\eta_{X_{ik}}^{P_{j}} = \\frac{\\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial P_{j}}{P_{j}}\\Bigg)}{\\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial X_{ik}}{X_{ik}}\\Bigg)} = \\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial P_{j}}{\\partial X_{ik}}\\Bigg) \\times \\Bigg(\\frac{X_{ik}}{P_{j}}\\Bigg) \\ \\forall j\\ne i \\tag{4.54} \\end{equation}\\] We substitute equation 4.46 into 4.53 to obtain the following expression for cross elasticity of logit model probabilities: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle \\eta_{X_{ik}}^{P_{i}} = (-\\beta_{k}P_{i}P_{j})\\Bigg(\\frac{X_{ik}}{P_{j}}\\Bigg) = -\\beta_{k}X_{ik}P_{i} \\tag{4.55} \\end{equation}\\] An important property of MNL models is that the cross-elasticities are the same for all the other alternatives in the choice set. This property of the multinomial logit model is another manifestation of the IIA property discussed in the previous section. The elasticity expressions derived above are based on the assumption that the independent variables for which the elasticities are being derived are continuous variables (e.g., travel time and travel cost). However, if the variable of interest is discrete in nature (e.g., number of automobiles in a household), it is not differentiable by definition. For this reason, derivatives can not be derived for ordinal or categorical variables. An alternative is to calculate the incremental change is each probability with respect to a one unit change in an ordered variable or a category shift for categorical variables and to use the differences to compute arc elasticities. 4.5 Measures of Responses to Changes in Decision Maker Characteristics Choice probabilities in logit models are also a function of the values of the characteristics of the decision maker (traveler). Therefore, it is equally useful to know the extent to which the probabilities of alternatives change in response to changes in the value of these characteristics. For example, in a traveler’s mode choice decision, an important question is to what extent the probability of choosing a mode will decrease/increase, if the income of the traveler changes by a certain amount. This section formulates both the derivatives and elasticity equations for evaluating such responses and thereby provides understanding and quantifies the response to changes in the characteristics of travelers. 4.5.1 Derivatives of Choice Probabilities Derivatives indicate the change in probability of each alternative in the choice set per unit change in a characteristic of the traveler. The analysis approach is similar to that employed in section 4.4. The important difference is that in section 4.4, we were assessing the impact of a change in probability of an alternative in response to a change in an attribute of a single alternative; either the same alternative (direct-derivative and direct-elasticity) or another alternative (cross-derivative and cross-elasticity). In the case of traveler characteristics, those characteristics may appear in alternative specific form in all alternatives (except for one reference alternative). Thus, we are considering what, in effect, becomes a combination of one direct response and multiple cross responses. Consider, for example, the probability of choosing alternative \\(i\\) in response to a change in income, specific to alternative \\(i\\). That is, \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial Inc_i} = (1 - P_i)P_i\\beta_{Inc_i} \\tag{4.56} \\end{equation}\\] However, since an identical change in income will occur for all alternatives in which income appears as an alternative specific variable, we consider the cross-derivative of the probability of choosing alternative \\(i\\) in response to a change in income, specific to alternative \\(j\\). That is, \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial Inc_j} = -P_iP_j\\beta_{Inc,_j} \\tag{4.57} \\end{equation}\\] The corresponding sum over all alternatives \\(i \\ne j\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{j\\ne i}\\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial Inc_j} = -P_i\\sum_{j \\ne i}P_j\\beta_{Inc,_j} \\tag{4.58} \\end{equation}\\] and the sum over all alternatives including \\(i\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial Inc} = P_i(1-P_i)\\beta_{Inc,_i}-\\sum_{j\\ne i}P_iP_j\\beta_{Inc,_j}\\\\ = P_i\\beta_{Inc,_j} - \\sum_{\\forall j}P_iP_j\\beta_{Inc,_j}\\\\ = P_i[\\beta_{Inc,_i} - \\sum_{\\forall j}P_j\\beta_{Inc,_j}]\\\\ = P_i[\\beta_{Inc,_i} - \\overline{\\beta}_{Inc}]\\\\ \\end{split} \\tag{4.59} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\overline{\\beta}_{Inc}\\) is the probability weighted average of the alternative specific income parameters That is, the derivative of the probability with respect to a change in income is equal to the probability times the amount by which the income coefficient for that alternative exceeds the probability weighted average income coefficient over all alternatives9. It should be apparent that the sum over all alternatives of the income derivatives must be equal to one to ensure that the total probability over all alternatives is unchanged by any change in income. This can be shown by summing equation 4.58 over all alternatives in the choice set. 4.5.2 Elasticities of Choice Probabilities Elasticity is another measure that can be used to quantify the extent to which the choice probabilities are influenced by changes in a variable; in this case, a variable that describes the characteristics of the traveler. In this case, the elasticity of the probability of alternative \\(i\\) to a change in income is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\eta_{Inc}^{P_i} = (\\beta_{Inc_i} - \\overline{\\beta}_{Inc}) \\times Inc \\tag{4.60} \\end{equation}\\] As before, the elasticity represents the proportional change in probability of an alternative to a proportional change in the explanatory variable. 4.6 Model Estimation: Concept and Method Logit model development consists of formulating model specifications and estimating numerical values of the parameters for the various attributes specified in each utility function by fitting the models to the observed choice data. The critical elements of this process become the selection of a preferred specification based on statistical measures and judgment. Under some circumstances, the model developer may impose constraints on the estimation to ensure desired relationships with respect to the relative value of different variables. 4.6.1 Graphical Representation of Model Estimation We illustrate the basic concepts of model estimation using a binary choice model with two variables and no constant. Consider that the only two modes available to a traveler are auto and bus and the deterministic component of the utility function for the two modes is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{Auto} = \\beta_1 \\times TravelTime_{Auto} + \\beta_{2} \\times TravelCost_{Auto} \\tag{4.61} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{Bus} = \\beta_1 \\times TravelTime_{Bus} + \\beta_{2} \\times TravelCost_{Bus} \\tag{4.62} \\end{equation}\\] Let us assume that in this example, bus has higher travel time and lower cost than car. For a traveler, the choice of travel mode will depend on his/her relative valuation of travel time and travel cost. A traveler who values time much more than cost will have a higher utility for car; whereas, a traveler who values time less than cost will have a higher utility for bus. This concept is illustrated in Figure 4.5 which shows the time and cost values for auto and bus iso-utility line10 for both types of travelers. When the iso-utility lines are steep enough to ensure that some iso-utility line is below bus and above car (case 1) implying a low value of time, bus will be the chosen mode. Conversely, if the iso-utility lines are flat enough to ensure that some iso-utility line is below car and above bus (case 2) implying a high value of time, car will be the chosen mode. The concept of iso-utility lines can be used to graphically describe the estimation of model parameters using observed choice data. This is illustrated in Figure 4.6 which shows the observed choice data for two travelers where each traveler has a choice between bus and car. The first traveler chooses bus (Bus 1) whereas the second traveler chooses car (Car 2). The objective is to find an iso-utility line with a slope that is steep enough to place Bus 1 above Car 1 and flat enough to place Bus 2 below Car 2. The figure shows that there many iso-utility lines with different slopes that satisfy the above conditions. However, even with only two observations, the range of the slopes of these lines is limited. The addition of more choice observation will further reduce the possible range of iso-utility lines. If all choosers are governed by the strict utility equations 4.60 and 4.61; additional observations will narrow the range of results to any satisfactory level of precision. However, as discussed previously, we expect that the analyst will not know all the variables that influence the traveler’s choice and/or will measure some variables differently than the user. Thus, it is unlikely that the observations can be separated by a single boundary. In this case, it becomes necessary to use an estimation method which scores different estimation results in terms of how well they identify the chosen alternatives. This is accomplished by using maximum likelihood estimation methods. The maximum likelihood method consists of finding model parameters which maximize the likelihood (posterior probability) of the observed choices conditional on the model. That is, to maximize the likelihood that the sample was generated from the model with the selected parameter values. 4.6.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation Theory The procedure for maximum likelihood estimation involves two important steps: 1) developing a joint probability density function of the observed sample, called the likelihood function, and 2) estimating parameter values which maximize the likelihood function. The likelihood function for a sample of ‘T’ individuals, each with ‘J’ alternatives is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\beta) = \\prod_{\\forall t \\in T} \\prod_{\\forall j \\in J}(P_{jt}(\\beta))^{\\delta_{jt}} \\tag{4.63} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\delta_{jt} = 1\\) is chosen indicator (\\(=1\\)if \\(j\\) is chosen by individual \\(t\\) and 0, otherwise) and \\(P_{jt}\\) is the probability that individual \\(t\\) chooses alternative \\(j\\). The values of the parameters which maximize the likelihood function are obtained by finding the first derivative of the likelihood function and equating it to zero. Since the log of a function yields the same maximum as the function and is more convenient to differentiate, we maximize the log-likelihood function instead of the likelihood function itself. The expressions for the log likelihood function and its first derivative are shown in equations (4.64) and (4.65) respectively: \\[\\begin{equation} LL(\\beta) = Log(L(\\beta)) = \\sum_{\\forall t \\in T} \\sum_{\\forall j \\in J} \\delta_{jt} \\times ln(P_{jt}(\\beta)) \\tag{4.64} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial (LL)}{\\partial \\beta_k} = \\sum_{\\forall t \\in T} \\sum_{\\forall j \\in J} \\delta_{jt} \\times \\frac{1}{P_{jt}} \\times \\frac{\\partial P_{jt}(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} \\qquad \\forall k \\tag{4.65} \\end{equation}\\]11 Further development of the derivative requires representation of the probability function, \\(P_{jt}\\), expanded from the version that appears in Equation 4.5 is \\[\\begin{equation} P_{jt}= \\frac{\\exp({X&#39;}_{jt}\\beta)}{\\sum_{j&#39;}\\exp({X&#39;}_{jt}\\beta)} \\tag{4.66} \\end{equation}\\] and the first derivative with respect to each element of \\(\\beta\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial P_{jt}}{\\partial \\beta_k} = P_{jt}\\left({X&#39;}_{jkt}-\\sum_{j&#39;}P_{j&#39;t}X_{j&#39;kt}\\right) \\forall k \\tag{4.67} \\end{equation}\\]12 Substituting Equation (4.67) into Equation 4.64 gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial (LL)}{\\partial \\beta_k} = \\sum_{\\forall t \\in T} \\sum_{\\forall j \\in J} \\delta_{jt} \\left({X&#39;}_{jt} - \\sum_{j&#39;t} P_{j&#39;t}X_{j&#39;t} \\right) \\\\ = \\sum_{\\forall t \\in T} \\sum_{\\forall j \\in J} (\\delta_{jt} - P_{j&#39;t}) {X&#39;}_{jt} \\forall k \\tag{4.68} \\end{equation}\\] for the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\beta_k\\). The maximum likelihood is obtained by setting Equation (4.68) equal to zero and solving for the best values of the parameter vector, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\). We can be sure this is the solution for a maximum value provided that the second derivative is negative definite. In this case, the second derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\beta\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial^2 (LL)}{\\partial \\beta \\partial \\beta&#39;} = \\sum_{\\forall t \\in T} \\sum_{\\forall j \\in J} - P_{j&#39;t}({X&#39;}_{jt}-\\overline{X}_t)({X&#39;}_{jt}-\\overline{X}_t)&#39; \\tag{4.69} \\end{equation}\\] is negative definite for all values of \\(\\beta\\). Equations (4.68) and (4.69) are used to solve the maximum likelihood problem using a variety of available algorithms. In most practical problems, this involves significant computations and specialized computer programs to find the desired solution. The following example illustrates the application of maximum likelihood to estimate logit model parameters. 4.6.3 Example of Maximum Likelihood Estimation Suppose a logit model of binary choice between car and bus is to be estimated. For simplicity, let us assume the utility specification includes only the travel time variable and that the deterministic portion of the utility function for the two modes is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} $\\displaystyle V_{Auto} = \\beta_{1} \\times Travel \\ Time_{Auto}$ \\tag{4.70} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} $\\displaystyle V_{Bus} = \\beta_{1} \\times Travel \\ Time_{Bus}$ \\tag{4.71} \\end{equation}\\] Suppose that the estimation sample consists of observations of mode choice of only three individuals. The modal travel times and observed choice for each of the three individuals in the sample is as follows: Individual # Auto Travel Time Bus Travel Time Chosen Mode 1 30 minutes 50 minutes Car (mode 1) 2 20 minutes 10 minutes Car (mode 2) 3 40 minutes 30 minutes Bus (mode 2) According to the logit model, the probabilities for the observed mode for each individual are: \\[\\begin{align} \\text{Individual}_1 \\ (P_{11}) &amp;= \\frac{\\exp(30\\beta)}{\\exp(50\\beta)+\\exp(30\\beta)} = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(20\\beta)} \\tag{4.72}\\\\ \\text{Individual}_2 (P_{12}) &amp;= \\frac{\\exp(20\\beta)}{\\exp(10\\beta)+\\exp(20\\beta)} = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(-10\\beta)} \\tag{4.73}\\\\ \\text{Individual}_3 \\ (P_{23}) &amp;= \\frac{\\exp(30\\beta)}{\\exp(30\\beta)+\\exp(40\\beta)} = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(10\\beta)} \\tag{4.74} \\end{align}\\] The log-likelihood expression for this sample will be as follows: \\[\\begin{align} LL &amp;= \\sum_{j=1,2}\\sum_{t=1,2,3}\\delta_{jt} \\times \\ln(P_{jt})\\\\ &amp;= 1 \\times \\ln(P_{11}) + 0 \\times \\ln(P_{21}) + 1 \\times \\ln(P_{12}) \\ldots \\\\ &amp;= \\ln(P_{11})+\\ln(P_{12})+\\ln(P_{23})\\\\ \\tag{4.75} \\end{align}\\] A maximum likelihood estimator finds the value of the parameter \\(\\beta\\) which maximizes the log-likelihood value. This solution is obtained by setting the first derivative of the log-likelihood function equal to zero, and solving for \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\). However, for this illustrative example, we can plot the graph for log-likelihood (or likelihood) as a function of \\(\\beta\\) to find the point where the maximum occurs. Figure 4.5 shows the graph of likelihood and log-likelihood as a function of \\(\\beta\\). It can be seen that the point where the maximum occurs is identical for both the likelihood and the log-likelihood functions, i.e., at \\(\\beta = -0.076\\). This value is called the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\beta\\). Practical applications of logit models include multiple parameters and many observations. Consequently, the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters cannot be found graphically. Specialized software packages are available for this purpose. # calculate probabilities for example individuals demo_ps &lt;- function(beta){ v1a &lt;- beta * 30 v1t &lt;- beta * 50 p1 &lt;- exp(v1a) / (exp(v1t) + exp(v1a)) v2a &lt;- beta * 20 v2t &lt;- beta * 10 p2 &lt;- exp(v2a) / (exp(v2t) + exp(v2a)) v3a &lt;- beta * 40 v3t &lt;- beta * 30 p3 &lt;- exp(v3t) / (exp(v3t) + exp(v3a)) c(p1, p2, p3) } # calculate likelihood function demo_likelihood &lt;- function(beta) { ps &lt;- demo_ps(beta) prod(ps) } # calculate log-likelihood demo_loglikelihood &lt;- function(beta) { ps &lt;- demo_ps(beta) sum(log(ps)) } tibble( beta = seq(-0.2, 0, by = 0.001) ) %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate( Likelihood = demo_likelihood(beta), `Log Likelihood` = demo_loglikelihood(beta) ) %&gt;% gather(likelihood, value, -beta) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = beta, y = value)) + geom_line() + xlab(expression(beta)) + ylab(&quot;Likelihood Function Value&quot;) + facet_grid(likelihood ~ ., scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 4.5: Likelihood and log-likelihood as a function of a parameter value.

The chapter is organized as follows: Section 5.2 presents an overview of the data required to estimate mode choice models. Section 5.3 reviews data collection approaches for obtaining traveler and trip-related data. Section 5.4 discusses the methods for collecting data which describes the availability and service characteristics of the various modal alternatives. Section 5.5 illustrates two different data structures used by software packages for estimation of MNL and NL models. Section 5.6 describes the data used to estimate work mode choice model in the San Francisco Bay Region. Section 5.7 describes preliminary estimation results for mode choice to work based on this data and interpret these results in terms of judgment, descriptive measures and statistical tests. Section 5.8 goes into more detail on value of time estimates retrieved from choice models. CHAPTER 6 extends this example to the estimation of more sophisticated models. CHAPTER 7 develops a parallel example for shop/other mode choice in the San Francisco Bay Region. CHAPTER 9 extends the examples from previous chapters and explores nested logit models for work and shop/other trips in the San Francisco Bay Region. Additional examples based on data collected in different urban regions are presented in the appendices. 5.2 Data Requirements Overview The first step in the development of a choice model is to assemble data about traveler choice and the variables believed to influence that choice process. In the context of travel mode choice, such data include: Traveler and trip related variables that influence the travelers’ assessment of modal alternatives (e.g., income, automobile ownership, trip purpose, time of day of travel, origin and destination of trip, and travel party size), Mode related variables describing each alternative available to the traveler (e.g., travel time, travel cost and service frequency for carrier modes) and The observed or reported mode choice of the traveler (the “dependent” or “endogenous” variable). The first two categories of variables are selected to describe the factors which influence each decision maker’s choice of an alternative. These independent or exogenous variables are likely to differ across trip purpose. The commonly used explanatory variables in mode choice models include: Traveler (Decision Maker) Related Variables: Income of traveler or traveler’s household, Number of automobiles in traveler’s household, Number of workers in traveler’s household, Sex of the traveler, Age group of the traveler, Functions of these variables such as number of autos divided by number of workers Trip Context Variables: Trip purpose, Employment density at the traveler’s workplace, Population density at the home location and Dummy variable indicating whether the traveler’s workplace is in the Central Business District (CBD). Mode (Alternative) Related Variables: Total travel time, In-vehicle travel time, Out-of-vehicle travel time, Walk time, Wait time, Number of transfers Transit headway and Travel cost. Interaction of Mode and Traveler or Trip Related Variables: Travel cost divided by household income, Travel time or cost interacted with sex or age group of traveler, and Out-of-vehicle time divided by total trip distance. 5.3 Sources and Methods for Traveler and Trip Related Data Collection Traveler and trip related data (including the actual mode choice of the traveler) needed for estimation of mode choice models are generally obtained by surveying a sample of travelers from the population of interest. This section discusses the types of surveys that may be used to obtain traveler and/or trip-related information (Section 5.3.1) and associated sample design considerations (Section 5.3.2). 5.3.1 Travel Survey Types There are several types of travel surveys. The most common of these are household, workplace and intercept surveys. Household Travel Surveys involve contacting respondents in their home and collecting information regarding their household characteristics (e.g., number of members in household, automobile ownership, etc.), their personal characteristics (such as income, work status, etc.) and the travel decisions made in the recent past (e.g., number of trips, mode of travel for each trip, etc.). Historically, most household traveler surveys were conducted through personal interviews in the respondent’s home. Currently, most household travel surveys are conducted using telephone or mail-back surveys, or a combination of both. It is common practice to include travel diaries as a part of the household travel survey. Travel diaries are a daily log of all trips (including information about trip origin and destination, start and end time, mode of travel, purpose at the origin and destination, etc.) made by each household member during a specified time period. This information is used to develop trip generation, trip distribution, and mode choice models for various trip purposes. Recently, travel diaries have been extended to include detailed information about the activities engaged in at each stop location and at home to provide a better understanding of the motivation for each trip and to associate trips of different purposes with different members of the household. Also, in some cases, diaries have been collected repeatedly from the same ‘panel’ of respondents to understand changes in their behavior over time. Workplace Surveys involve contacting respondents at their workplace. The information collected is similar to that for household surveys but focuses exclusively on the traveler working at that location and on his/her work and work-related trips. Such surveys are of particular interest in understanding work commute patterns of individuals and in designing alternative commuter services. Destination Surveys involve contacting respondents at other destinations. Similar information is collected as for workplace surveys but the objective is to learn more about travel to other types of destinations and possibly to develop transportation services which better serve such destinations. Intercept Surveys “intercept” potential respondents during their travel. The emphasis of the survey is on collecting information about the specific trip being undertaken by the traveler. Intercept surveys are commonly used for intercity travel studies due to the high cost of identifying intercity travelers through home-based or work-based surveys. In intercept surveys, travelers are intercepted at a roadside rest area for highway travel and on board carriers (or at carrier terminals) for other modes of travel. The traveler is usually given a brief survey (paper or interview) for immediate completion or future response and/or recruited for a future phone survey. A variant of highway intercept surveys is to record the license plate of vehicles and subsequently contact the owners of a sample of vehicles to obtain information on the trip that was observed. Intercept surveys can be used to cover all available modes or they can be used to enrich a household or workplace survey sample by providing additional observations for users of infrequently used modes since few such users are likely to be identified through household or workplace surveys. 5.3.2 Sampling Design Considerations The first issue to consider in sample design is the population of interest in the study. Obviously, the population of interest will depend on the purpose of the study. In the context of urban work mode choice analysis, the population of interest would be all commuters in the urban region. In the context of non-business intercity mode choice, the population of interest would be all non-business intercity travelers in the relevant corridor. However, most surveys are designed to addresses a number of current or potential analysis and decision issues. Thus, the population of interest is selected based on the full range of such issues and is likely to include a wide range of households and household members each undertaking a variety of trips. After identifying the population of interest, the next step in sample design is to determine the unit for sampling. The sampling units should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaust the population. Thus, if the population of interest is commuters in an urban region, the sampling unit could be firms in the area (whose employees collectively represent the commuting population). Within each firm, all or a sample of workers could be interviewed. However, if the survey is addressed to multiple urban travel issues, the population of interest is likely to be all individuals or households resident in the urban region. A comprehensive list of all sampling units constitutes the sampling frame. This may be a directory of firms or households obtained from a combination of public and private sources such as local or regional commerce departments, business directories, tourism offices, utilities, etc. Of course, the sampling frame may not always completely represent the population of interest. For example, some commuters may be employed by firms outside the urban region and some households may not have telephones or other utility connections. Once the sampling frame is determined, a sampling design is used to select a sample of cases. The most common class of sampling procedures is probability sampling, where each sampling unit has a pre-determined probability of being selected into the survey sample. A probability sampling procedure in which each sampling unit has an equal probability of being selected is simple random sampling. In this method, the sampling units are selected randomly from the sampling frame. This would apply to household sampling, for example. An alternative approach for work place sampling would be to sample each employer to further sample workers for those employers sampled. This is referred to as a two-stage sample. In either case, the result is an unbiased sample which is representative of the population of interest. Simple random sampling offers the advantage of being easy to understand, communicate, and implement in the field, making it less prone to errors. However, a random sample may not adequately represent some population segments of interest. This problem can be addressed by using stratified random sampling. This entails partitioning the sampling frame into several mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive segments (or strata) based on one or more stratification variables, followed by random sampling within each stratum. Thus, households in a region may be stratified by location within the region; city vs. suburban residence; or income. Similarly, employment firms in a region may be stratified by the number of employees or the type of business. Stratified random sampling may be useful in cases where it is important to understand the characteristics of certain subpopulations as well as the overall population. For example, it might be useful to study the mode choice behavior of employees working for very small employers in a region and compare their behavior with those of employees working for large employers. But if the number of small employers in a region is a small proportion of all employers, they may not be well-represented in a simple random sample. In such a case, the analyst might stratify the sampling frame to ensure adequate representation of very small employers in the survey sample. Stratified random sampling can also be less expensive than simple random sampling. This can occur, for example, because per-person sampling is less expensive if a few large employers are targeted rather than several smaller ones. Finally, increased dispersion in the range of important independent variables can be increased through “clever” identification of alternative strata based on income, household size, number of vehicles owned or number of workers providing benefits in estimation efficiency. The use of stratified random sampling does not present any new problems in estimation as long as the stratification variable(s) is (are) exogenous to the choice process. However, in some situations, one may want to use the discrete choice of interest (the dependent or endogenous variable) as the stratification variable. For example, if the bus mode is rarely chosen for urban or intercity travel, a random sampling procedure or even an exogenously stratified sample might not provide sufficient observations of bus riders to understand the factors that affect the choice of the bus mode. In this case, bus riders can be intentionally over sampled by interviewing them at bus stops or on board the buses. Such choice based sampling may also be motivated by cost considerations. Special techniques are required to estimate model parameters using choice based sampling methods. A further problem is that it may be difficult to obtain a random sample as it may not be possible to get an up to date and complete list of potential respondents from which to select a sample. This is the primary reason for using “deterministic rules” of sampling. In systematic sampling, sample units are drawn by deterministic rather than random rules. For example, rather than drawing a random sample of 5 percent all households in a region from a published directory, a systematic sampling plan may pick out every 20th household in the directory. As long as there is no inherent bias in setting up the deterministic rule, the systematic sampling plan is essentially equivalent to random sampling, and the choice of one over the other may be a matter of operational convenience. In addition to the sampling approaches discussed above, combinations of the approaches can also be used. For example, enriched sampling uses a combination of household or workplace sampling with choice based sampling to increase the number of transit users in the study data. As with choice based sampling, special estimation techniques are required to offset the biases associated with this sampling approach. Another issue in survey sampling is the sample size to be used. The size of the sample required to adequately represent the population is a function of the level of statistical accuracy and confidence desired from the survey. The precision of parameter estimates and the statistical validity of estimation results improve with sample size. However, the cost of the survey also increases with sample size and in many cases it is necessary to restrict the sample size to ensure that the cost of the survey remains within budgetary constraints. The decision about sample size requires a careful evaluation of the need for adequate data to satisfy study objectives vis-à-vis budgetary constraints. Interested readers are referred to M. Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985) or Börsch-Supan (1987) for a more comprehensive discussion of sampling methods and sample size issues. 5.4 Methods for Collecting Mode Related Data Surveys can be used to collect information describing the trip maker and his or her household, the context of the trip (purpose, time of day, frequency of travel, origin, and destination), the chosen mode and the respondent’s perception of travel service. However, objective data about modal service (mode availability and level of service) must be obtained from other sources. Modal data is usually generated from simulation of network service characteristics including carrier schedules and fare and observed volumes, travel times and tolls on roadway links. Network analysis provides the zone-to-zone in-vehicle travel times for the highway (non-transit) and transit modes (the urban area is divided into several traffic analysis zones for travel demand analysis purposes). The highway out-of-vehicle time by the highway mode is assigned a nominal value to reflect walk access/egress to/from the car. The transit out-of-vehicle time is based on transit schedules, the presence or absence of transfers, and location of bus stops vis-à-vis origin and destination locations. The highway distance of travel is obtained from the network structure and a per-mile vehicle operation cost is applied to obtain highway zone-to-zone driving costs. Parking costs are obtained from per-hour parking rates at the destination zone multiplied by half the estimated duration of the activity pursued at the destination zone (allowing half the parking cost to be charged to the incoming and departing trips) and toll costs can be identified from the network. Transit cost is determined from the actual fare for travel between zones plus any access costs to/from the transit station from/to the origin/destination. The highway in-vehicle times, out-of-vehicle times, and costs are used as the relevant values for driving alone and these values are modified appropriately to reflect increased in-vehicle times and decreased driving/parking costs for the shared ride modes. The travel times for non-motorized modes (such as bike and walk) are obtained from the zone-to-zone distance and an assumed walk/bike speed. Finally, the appropriate travel times and cost between zones is appended to each trip in the trip file based on the origin and destination zones of the trip. 5.5 Data Structure for Estimation # Read in raw SPSS file # # We received the work mode choice dataset from Laurie Garrow, who had converted # the file into a labeled SPSS data object. This code reads the file into R # using the haven::read_spss function, and then creates a new alternative column # as the label of the alternative number sf_work_mode &lt;- read_spss(&quot;data-raw/Work Trips/SPSS/SF MTC Work MC Data NewVars.sav&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(altname = as_factor(altnum, levels = &quot;labels&quot;)) # Convert into mlogit dfidx data frame # mlogit requires instructions on which rows are the alternative, and which rows # are the cases. This dataset is in IDCase-ALT format sf_mlogit &lt;- dfidx(sf_work_mode, idx = c(&quot;case&quot;, &quot;altname&quot;)) # write to data/ folder for future use write_rds(sf_mlogit, &quot;data/worktrips.rds&quot;) The data collected from the various sources described in the previous sections must be assembled into a single data set to support model estimation. This can be accomplished using a variety of spreadsheet, data base, statistical software or user prepared programs. The structure of the resultant data files must satisfy the format requirements of the software packages designed for choice model estimation. The commonly used software packages for discrete choice model estimation require the data to be structured in one of two formats: a) the trip format or b) the trip-alternative format. This are commonly referred to as IDCase (each record contains all the information for mode choice over alternatives for a single trip) or IDCase-IDAlt (each record contains all the information for a single mode available to each trip maker so there is one record for each mode for each trip). In the trip format, each record provides all the relevant information about an individual trip, including the traveler/trip related variables, mode related variables for all available modes and a variable indicating which alternative was chosen. In the trip-alternative format, each record includes information on the traveler/trip related variables, the attributes of that modal alternative, and a choice variable that indicates whether the alternative was or was not chosen.13 The two data structures are illustrated in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 for four observations (individuals) with up to three modal alternatives available. The first columns in both formats is the household and person ID value. In the trip (or IDCase) format, this is followed by traveler/trip related variables (e.g., income), the level of service (time and cost in the figure) variables associated with each alternative and a variable that indicates the chosen alternative. In the trip-alternative (or IDCase-IDAlt) format, the second column generally identifies the alternative number with which that record is associated. Additional columns will generally include a 0-1 variable indicating the chosen alternative,14 the number of alternatives available, traveler/trip related variables mode related attributes for the alternative with which the record is associated. The unavailability of an alternative is indicated in the trip format by zeros Either of the two data formats may be used to represent the information required for model estimation. The choice is based on the programming decisions of the software developer taking into account data storage and computational implications of each choice. #trip-alt trip_alt &lt;- sf_work_mode %&gt;% filter(case &lt;= 4) %&gt;% select(hhid, perid, Alternative = altname, chosen, IVTT = ivtt, Income = hhinc) kbl(trip_alt, caption= &quot;Data Layout Type II: Trip-Alternative Format&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() Table 5.1: Data Layout Type II: Trip-Alternative Format hhid perid Alternative chosen IVTT Income 2 1 Drive alone 1 13.38 42.5 2 1 Share ride 2 0 18.38 42.5 2 1 Share ride 3+ 0 20.38 42.5 2 1 Transit 0 25.90 42.5 2 1 Bike 0 40.50 42.5 3 1 Drive alone 0 29.92 17.5 3 1 Share ride 2 0 34.92 17.5 3 1 Share ride 3+ 0 21.92 17.5 3 1 Transit 1 22.96 17.5 3 1 Bike 0 58.95 17.5 5 1 Drive alone 1 8.60 12.5 5 1 Share ride 2 0 13.60 12.5 5 1 Share ride 3+ 0 15.60 12.5 5 1 Transit 0 16.87 12.5 6 1 Drive alone 0 30.60 55.0 6 1 Share ride 2 0 35.70 55.0 6 1 Share ride 3+ 0 22.70 55.0 6 1 Transit 1 24.27 55.0 trip_format &lt;- sf_work_mode %&gt;% filter(case &lt;= 4) %&gt;% select(hhid, perid, chosen, ivtt, Income = hhinc, altname, altnum) %&gt;% group_by(hhid, perid) %&gt;% mutate( chosen = altname[which(chosen == 1)], altname = str_c(altname, &quot; - Travel Time&quot;)) %&gt;% select(-altnum) %&gt;% spread(altname, ivtt, fill = 0) kbl(head(trip_format), caption= &quot;Data Layout Type I: Trip Format&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() Table 5.2: Data Layout Type I: Trip Format hhid perid chosen Income Bike - Travel Time Drive alone - Travel Time Share ride 2 - Travel Time Share ride 3+ - Travel Time Transit - Travel Time 2 1 Drive alone 42.5 40.50 13.38 18.38 20.38 25.90 3 1 Transit 17.5 58.95 29.92 34.92 21.92 22.96 5 1 Drive alone 12.5 0.00 8.60 13.60 15.60 16.87 6 1 Transit 55.0 0.00 30.60 35.70 22.70 24.27 5.6 Application Data for Work Mode Choice in the San Francisco Bay Area The examples used in previous chapters are based on simulated or hypothetical data to highlight fundamental concepts of multinomial logit choice models. Henceforth, our discussion of model specification and interpretation of results will be based on application data sets assembled from travel survey and other data collection to support transportation decision making in selected urban regions. Use of real data provides richer examples and “hands-on” experience in estimating mode choice models. The data used in this chapter was collected for the analysis of work trip mode choice in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1990. The San Francisco Bay Area work mode choice data set comprises 5,029 home-to-work commute trips in the San Francisco Bay Area. The data is drawn from the San Francisco Bay Area Household Travel Survey conducted by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) in the spring and fall of 1990 (see ((???), 1991) for details of survey sampling and administration procedures). This survey included a one day travel diary for each household member older than five years and detailed individual and household socio-demographic information. There are six work mode choice alternatives in the region: drive alone, shared-ride with 2 people, shared ride with 3 or more people, transit, bike, and walk.15 The drive alone mode is available for a trip only if the trip-maker’s household has a vehicle available and if the trip-maker has a driver’s license. The shared-ride modes (with 2 people and with 3 or more people) are available for all trips. Transit availability is determined based on the residence and work zones of individuals. The bike mode is deemed available if the one-way home-to-work distance is less than 12 miles, while the walk mode is considered to be available if the one-way home to work distance is less than 4 miles (the distance thresholds to determine bike and walk availability are determined based on the maximum one-way distance of bike and walk-users, respectively). Level of service data were generated by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for each zone pair and for each mode. These data were appended to the home-based work trips based on the origin and destination of each trip. The data includes traveler, trip related area and mode related variables for each trip including in-vehicle travel time, out-of-vehicle travel time, travel cost, travel distance, and a mode availability indicator. Table 5.3 provides information about the availability and usage of each alternative and the average values of in-vehicle time, out-of-vehicle time and travel cost in the sample. Drive alone is available to most work commuters in the Bay Area and is the most frequently chosen alternative. The shared-ride modes are available for all trips (by construction) and together account for the next largest share of chosen alternatives. The combined total of drive alone and shared ride trips represent close to 85% of all work trips. Transit trips constitute roughly 10% of work trips, a substantially greater share than in most metropolitan regions in the U.S. The fraction of trips using non-motorized modes (walk and bike) constitutes a small but not insignificant portion of total trips. #calculations ======================================= #calculate IVTT sf_wm_ivtt &lt;- sf_work_mode %&gt;% select(hhid, perid, altnum, chosen, ivtt, hhinc) %&gt;% group_by(hhid, perid) %&gt;% mutate( chosen = max(chosen * altnum) ) %&gt;% spread(altnum, ivtt, fill = 0) ivtt_raw &lt;- apply(sf_wm_ivtt,2,function(x) mean(x[x&gt;0])) #calculate OVTT sf_wm_ovtt &lt;- sf_work_mode %&gt;% select(hhid, perid, altnum, chosen, ovtt, hhinc) %&gt;% group_by(hhid, perid) %&gt;% mutate( chosen = max(chosen * altnum) ) %&gt;% spread(altnum, ovtt, fill = 0) ovtt_raw &lt;- apply(sf_wm_ovtt,2,function(x) mean(x[x&gt;0])) #calculate OVTT for walk (using TVTT) sf_wm_tvtt &lt;- sf_work_mode %&gt;% select(hhid, perid, altnum, chosen, tvtt, hhinc) %&gt;% group_by(hhid, perid) %&gt;% mutate( chosen = max(chosen * altnum) ) %&gt;% spread(altnum, tvtt, fill = 0) tvtt_raw &lt;- apply(sf_wm_tvtt,2,function(x) mean(x[x&gt;0])) #calculate market share Base_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ cost + tvtt | hhinc, data = sf_mlogit) mrktshr_raw &lt;- Base_model$freq / nrow(sf_wm_tvtt) #calculate COST sf_wm_cost &lt;- sf_work_mode %&gt;% select(hhid, perid, altnum, chosen, cost, hhinc) %&gt;% group_by(hhid, perid) %&gt;% mutate( chosen = max(chosen * altnum) ) %&gt;% spread(altnum, cost, fill = 0) cost_raw &lt;- apply(sf_wm_cost,2,function(x) mean(x[x&gt;0])) #create the table ================================== statsJtoWork &lt;- tibble( &quot;Mode&quot;= c(&quot;1.

Travel time and travel cost represent mode related attributes; all other things being equal, a faster mode of travel is more likely to be chosen than a slower mode and a less expensive mode is more likely to be chosen than a costlier mode. Household income is included in the model with the expectation that travelers from high income households are more likely to drive alone than to use other travel modes. The multinomial logit work trip mode choice models are estimated using ALOGIT, LIMDEP and ELM software, to illustrate differences in the outputs of these packages,16 as well as a specially programmed module for Matlab. The data sets, input control files, and estimation output results for this a selection of other model specifications for both software packages are included in the CD-ROM supplied with this manual. The Matlab module code, command files and output for all specifications in the manual are also included in the CD-ROM. The travel time (TT) and travel cost (TC) variables are specified as generic in this model. This implies that an increase of one unit of travel time or travel cost has the same impact on modal utility for all six modes. Household Income (Inc) is included as an alternative-specific variable. The drive alone mode is considered the base alternative for household income and the modal constants (see section 4.1.2.2 for a discussion of the need for a base alternative for these variables). The following mode labels are used in the subsequent discussion and equations: DA (drive alone), SR2 (shared ride with 2 people), SR3+ (shared ride with 3 or more people), TR (transit), BK (bike) and WK (walk). The deterministic portion of the utility for these modes, based on the utility specification discussed above, may be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{DA} = \\beta_{1} \\times TT_{DA} + \\beta_{2} \\times TC_{DA} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{SR2} = \\beta_{SR2} + \\beta_{1} \\times TT_{SR2} + \\beta_{2} \\times TC_{SR2} + \\gamma_{SR2} \\times Inc \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{SR3+} = \\beta_{SR3+} + \\beta_{1} \\times TT_{SR3+} + \\beta_{2} \\times TC_{SR3+} + \\gamma_{SR3+} \\times Inc \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{TR} = \\beta_{TR} + \\beta_{1} \\times TT_{TR} + \\beta_{2} \\times TC_{TR} + \\gamma_{TR} \\times Inc \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{BK} = \\beta_{BK} + \\beta_{1} \\times TT_{BK} + \\beta_{2} \\times TC_{BK} + \\gamma_{BK} \\times Inc \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} V_{WK} = \\beta_{WK} + \\beta_{1} \\times TT_{WK} + \\beta_{2} \\times TC_{WK} + \\gamma_{WK} \\times Inc \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] The estimation results reported in this manual are obtained from software programmed using the mlogit package for R, with estimation code embedded in the document. The output for the above model specification is shown in structured format in Table 5.4. Other commercial and free software packages are available, including ALOGIT, LIMDEP, Biogeme (Python), Apollo (R), and ELM. The outputs from these and other software package typically include, at least, the following estimation results: Parameter17 names, parameter estimates, standard errors of these estimates and the corresponding t-statistics for each variable/parameter; Log-likelihood values at zero (equal probability model), constants only (market shares model) and at convergence and Rho-Squared and other indicators of goodness of fit. In addition, different software reports a variety of other information either as part of the default output or as a user selected option. These include: The number of observations, The number of cases for which each alternative is available, The number of cases for which each alternative is chosen, The number of iterations required to obtain convergence, and The status of the convergence process at each iteration. The value for the log-likelihood at zero and constants can be obtained for either software by estimating models without (zero) and with (constants) alternative specific constants18 and no other variables. Further, the log-likelihood at zero can be calculated directly as $ _t ln(1/NAlt_t)$ In the next three sections, we review the estimation results for the base model using informal judgment-based tests (section 5.7.1), goodness-of-fit measures (section 5.7.2), and statistical tests (section 5.7.3). These elements, taken together, provide a basis to evaluate each model and to compare models with different specifications. base &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ ivtt + cost, data = sf_mlogit) # estimate a model with constants only by constraining a single generic variable # to be zero market_shares &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ ivtt, data = sf_mlogit, constPar = c(&quot;ivtt&quot; = 0)) # Estimate a null model by constraining ALL the parameters to be zero. fixed_coefs &lt;- rep(0,6) %&gt;% setNames(c(names(coef(market_shares)), &quot;ivtt&quot;)) null_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ ivtt, data = sf_mlogit, start = fixed_coefs, iterlim = 0) basic_estimation &lt;- list( &quot;Null Model&quot; = null_model, &quot;Market Shares&quot; = market_shares, &quot;Base Model&quot; = base ) modelsummary( basic_estimation, title = &quot;Estimation Results for Zero Coefficient, Constants Only, and Base Models&quot; ) Table 5.4: Estimation Results for Zero Coefficient, Constants Only, and Base Models Null Model Market Shares Base Model (Intercept) × Share ride 2 0.000 -2.137 -2.425 (0.044) (0.048) (0.058) (Intercept) × Share ride 3++ 0.000 -3.303 -3.856 (0.046) (0.081) (0.095) (Intercept) × Transit 0.000 -1.950 -2.060 (0.053) (0.051) (0.065) (Intercept) × Bike 0.000 -3.335 -3.424 (0.085) (0.145) (0.166) (Intercept) × Walk 0.000 -2.040 -2.717 (0.073) (0.085) (0.096) ivtt 0.000 -0.032 (0.003) (0.005) cost -0.005 (0.000) Num.Obs. 5029 5029 5029 AIC 14631.2 8277.8 7600.3 BIC Log.Lik. -7309.601 -4132.916 -3793.129 rho2 -0.505 0.149 0.219 rho20 0.189 0.541 0.579 5.7.1 Informal Tests A variety of informal tests can be applied to an estimated model. These tests are designed to assess the reasonableness of the implications of estimated parameters. The most common tests concern: The sign of parameters (do the associated variables have a positive or negative effect on the alternatives with which they are associated?), The difference (positive or negative) within sets of alternative specific variables (does the inclusion of this variable have a more or less positive effect on one alternative relative to another?) and The ratio of pairs of parameters (is the ratio between the parameters of the correct sign and in a reasonable range?). 5.7.1.1 Signs of Parameters The most basic test of the estimation results is to examine the signs of the estimated parameters with theory, intuition and judgment regarding the expected impact of the corresponding variables. The estimated coefficients on the travel time and cost variables in Table 5.4 are negative, as expected, implying that the utility of a mode decreases as the mode becomes slower and/or more expensive. This, in turn, will reduce the choice probability of the corresponding mode. 5.7.1.2 Differences in Alternative Specific Variable Parameters across Alternatives We often have expectations about the impact of decision-maker characteristics on different alternatives. For example, when analyzing mode choice, we expect a number of variables to be more positive for automobile alternatives, especially Drive Alone, than for other alternatives. These include income, automobile ownership, home ownership, single family dwelling unit, etc. Since DA is the reference alternative in these models, we expect negative parameters on all alternative specific income variables, with small values for the shared ride alternatives and larger values for other alternatives, to reflect our intuition that increasing income will be associated with decreased preference for all other alternatives relative to drive alone. All the estimated alternative specific income parameters in Table 5.4 Estimation Results for Zero Coefficient, Constants Only and Base Models are negative, as expected, with the exception of the parameter for shared ride 3+. The positive sign for the shared ride 3+ parameter is counter-intuitive but very small and not significantly different from zero. An approach to address this problem is described in section 5.7.3.1. Additional informal tests involve comparisons among the estimated income parameters. The differences in the magnitude of these alternative-specific income parameters indicate the relative impact of increasing income on the utility and, hence, the choice probability of each mode. The results reported in Table 5 2 show that an increase in income will have a larger negative effect on the utilities of the non-motorized modes (bike and walk) than on those of transit and shared ride 2 modes. It is important to understand that the change in the choice probability of that alternative is not determined by the sign of the income parameter for a particular alternative but on the value of the parameter relative to the weighted mean of the income parameters across all alternatives, as described in section 4.5. For example, in the base model specification (Table 5.4), an increase in income will increase the probability of choosing drive alone and shared ride 3+ (the alternatives with the most positive parameters19) and will decrease the probability of choosing walk and bike (the alternatives with the smallest, most negative, parameters). However, the effect on shared ride 2 and transit is unclear; as income increases, they will lose some probability to drive alone and shared ride 3+ and gain some from walk and bike. The net effect will depend on the difference between the parameter for the alternative of interest and the individual choice probability weighted average of all the alternative specific income parameters (including zero for the base alternative) as illustrated in equation 4.58. 5.7.1.3 The Ratio of Pairs of Parameters The ratio of the estimated travel time and travel cost parameters provides an estimate of the value of time implied by the model; this can serve as another important informal test for evaluating the reasonableness of the model. For example, in the Base Model reported in Table 5.4, the implied value of time is \\(-0.0315962/-0.0050606\\) or 6.2435342 cents per minute (the units are determined from the units of the time and cost variables used in estimation). This is equivalent to $6.26 per hour which is much lower that the average wage rate in the area at the time of the survey, approximately $21.20 per hour, suggesting that the estimated value of time may be too low. We revisit this issue in greater detail in the next chapter. Similar ratios may be used to assess the reasonableness of the relative magnitudes of other pairs of parameters. These include out of vehicle time relative to in vehicle time, travel time reliability (if available) relative to average travel time, etc. 5.7.2 Overall Goodness-of-Fit Measures This section presents a descriptive measure, called the rho-squared value (\\(\\rho^2\\)) which can be used to describe the overall goodness of fit of the model. We can understand the formulation of this value in terms of the following figure which shows the scalar relationship among the log-likelihood values for a zero coefficients model (or the equally likely model), a constants only or market share model, the estimated model and a perfect prediction model. In the figure, LL(0) represents the log-likelihood with zero coefficients (which results in equal likelihood of choosing each available alternative), \\(LL(0)\\) represents the log-likelihood for the constants only model, \\(LL(\\hat{\\beta})\\) represents the log-likelihood for the estimated model and LL(*) = 0 is the log-likelihood for the perfect prediction model. Figure 5.1: Relationship between Different Log-likelihood Measures The relationships among modeling results will always appear in the order shown provided the estimated model includes a full set of alternative specific constants. That is, the constants only model is always better than the equally likely model, and the estimated model with constants is always better than the constants only model. The order of different estimated models will vary except that any model which is a restricted version of another model will be to the left of the unrestricted model. The rho-squared (\\(\\rho_0^2\\)) value is based on the relationship among the log-likelihood values indicated in Figure 5.2. It is simply the ratio of the distance between the reference model and the estimated model divided by the difference between the reference model and a perfect model. If the reference model is the equally likely model, the rho square with respect to zero, \\(\\rho_0^2\\), is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_0^2 = \\frac{LL(\\hat{\\beta}) - LL(0)}{LL(\\star) - LL(0)} \\tag{5.6} \\end{equation}\\] Since the log-likelihood value for the perfect model is zero,20 the \\(\\rho_0^2\\) measure reduces to: \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_0^2 = 1- \\frac{LL(\\hat{\\beta})}{LL(0)} \\tag{5.7} \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, the rho-square with respect to the constants only model is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_0^2 = \\frac{LL(\\hat{\\beta}) - LL(c)}{LL(\\star) - LL(c)} = 1- \\frac{LL(\\hat{\\beta})}{LL(c)} \\tag{5.8} \\end{equation}\\] By definition, the values of both rho-squared measures lie between 0 and 1 (this is similar to the R^2 measure for linear regression models). A value of zero implies that the model is no better than the reference model, whereas a value of one implies a perfect model; that is, every choice is predicted correctly. The rho-squared values for the basic model specification in Table 5.4 are computed based on the formulae shown below as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_0^2 = 1- \\frac{(-3626.2)}{(-7309.6)} = 0.5039 \\qquad \\rho_c^2 = 1- \\frac{(-3626.2)}{(-4132.9)} = 0.1226 \\tag{5.9} \\end{equation}\\] The rho-squared measures are widely used to describe the goodness of fit for choice models because of their intuitive formulation. The \\(\\rho_0^2\\) measures the improvement due to all elements of the model, including the fit to market shares, which is not very interesting for disaggregate analysis so it should not be used to assess models in which the sample shares are very unequal. The rho-squared measure with respect to the constant only model, \\(\\rho_c^2\\) , controls for the choice proportions in the estimation sample and is therefore a better measure to use for evaluating models. A problem with both rho-squared measures is that there are no guidelines for a “good” rho-squared value. Consequently, the measures are of limited value in assessing the quality of an estimated model and should be used with caution even in assessing the relative fit among alternative specifications. It is preferable to use the log-likelihood statistic (which has a formal and convenient mechanism to test among alternative model specifications) to support the selection of a preferred specification among alternative specifications. Another problem with the rho-squared measures is that they improve no matter what variable is added to the model independent of its importance. This directly results from the fact that the objective function of the model is being modeled with one or more additional degrees of freedom and that the same data that is used for estimation is used to assess the goodness of fit of the model. One approach to this problem is to replace the rho-squared measure with an adjusted rho-square measure which is designed to take account of these factors. The adjusted rho-squared for the zero model is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{\\rho_0^2} = \\frac{[LL(\\hat{\\beta}) - K] -LL(0)}{LL(\\star) - LL(0)} = 1-\\frac{LL(\\hat{\\beta}) - K}{LL(0)} \\tag{5.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(K\\) is the number of degrees of freedom (parameters) used in the model. The corresponding adjusted rho-squared for the constants only model is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{\\rho_c^2} = \\frac{LL(\\hat{\\beta}) - K - (LL(C)-K_{MS}}{LL(\\star) - (LL(C)-K_{MS})} = 1-\\frac{LL(\\hat{\\beta}) - K}{LL(C)-K_{MS}} \\tag{5.11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(K_{MS}\\) is the number of degrees of freedom (parameters) used in the constants only model. 5.7.3 Statistical Tests Statistical tests may be used to evaluate formal hypotheses about individual parameters or groups of parameters taken together. In this section we describe each of these tests. 5.7.3.1 Test of Individual Parameters There is sampling error associated with the model parameters because the model is estimated from only a sample of the relevant population (the relevant population includes all commuters in the Bay Area). The magnitude of the sampling error in a parameter is provided by the standard error associated with that parameter; the larger the standard error, the lower the precision with which the corresponding parameter is estimated. The standard error plays an important role in testing whether a particular parameter is equal to some hypothesized value, as we discuss next. The statistic used for testing the null hypothesis that a parameter \\(\\hat{\\beta_{k}}\\) is equal to some hypothesized value, \\({\\beta_{k}^*}\\), is the asymptotic t-statistic, which takes the following form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle t-statistic = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_{k}}-\\beta_{k}^{*}}{S_{k}} \\tag{5.12} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\hat{\\beta_{k}}\\) is the estimate for the \\(k^{th}\\) parameter, \\(\\beta_{k}^{*}\\) is the hypothesized value for the \\(k^{th}\\) parameter and \\(S_{k}\\) is the standard error of the estimate. Sufficiently large absolute values of the t-statistic lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis that the parameter is equal to the hypothesized value. When the hypothesized value, \\(\\beta_{k}^{*}\\), is zero, the t-statistic becomes the ratio of the estimated parameter to the standard error. The default estimation output from most software packages includes the t-statistic for the test of the hypothesis that the true value is zero. The rejection of this null hypothesis implies that the corresponding variable has a significant impact on the modal utilities and suggests that the variable should be retained in the model. Low absolute values of the t-statistic imply that the variable does not contribute significantly to the explanatory power of the model and can be considered for exclusion. If it is concluded that the hypothesis is not rejected, the equality constraint can be incorporated in the model by creating a new variable \\(X_{kl} = X_{k} + X_{l}\\) . The selection of a critical value for the t-statistic test is a matter of judgment and depends on the level of confidence with which the analyst wants to test his/her hypotheses. The critical t-values for different levels of confidence for samples sizes larger than 150 (which is the norm in mode choice analysis) are shown in Table 5-3. It should be apparent that the critical t-value increases with the desired level of confidence. Thus, one can conclude that a particular variable has no influence on choice (or equivalently that the true parameter associated with the variable is zero) can be rejected at the 90% level of confidence if the absolute value of the t-statistic is greater than 1.645 and at the 95% level of confidence if the t-statistic is greater than 1.960.21 tibble(confid = c(.9, .95, .99, .995, .999)) %&gt;% mutate(tval=qnorm((1-confid)/2, lower.tail = FALSE)) %&gt;% kbl(caption = &quot;Critical t-Values for Selected Confidence Levels and Large Samples&quot;, col.names = c(&quot;Confidence Level&quot;, &quot;Critical t-value (two-tailed test)&quot;)) %&gt;% kable_styling() Table 5.5: Critical t-Values for Selected Confidence Levels and Large Samples Confidence Level Critical t-value (two-tailed test) 0.900 1.644854 0.950 1.959964 0.990 2.575829 0.995 2.807034 0.999 3.290527 these_colors &lt;- wesanderson::wes_palette(&quot;Zissou1&quot;) ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4,4))) + # Plot the pdf stat_function( fun = function(x) dt(x, df = 29), aes(x), geom = &quot;area&quot;, color = &quot;grey75&quot;, fill = &quot;grey90&quot;, alpha = 1) + # Shade above 2 stat_function( fun = function(x) ifelse(x &gt;= 1.645, dt(x, df = 29), NA), aes(x), geom = &quot;area&quot;, color = NA, fill = these_colors[4], alpha = 1) + # Shade above 1.645 stat_function( fun = function(x) ifelse(x &gt;= 2, dt(x, df = 29), NA), aes(x), geom = &quot;area&quot;, color = NA, fill = these_colors[5], alpha = 1) + # Shade below -1.645 stat_function( fun = function(x) ifelse(x &lt;= -1.645, dt(x, df = 29), NA), aes(x), geom = &quot;area&quot;, color = NA, fill = these_colors[4], alpha = 1) + # Shade below -2 stat_function( fun = function(x) ifelse(x &lt;= -2, dt(x, df = 29), NA), aes(x), geom = &quot;area&quot;, color = NA, fill = these_colors[5], alpha = 1) + ggtitle(expression(paste(&quot;The&quot;, italic(t), &quot; distribution with a 90% and 95% confidence interval&quot;))) + xlab(expression(italic(t))) + theme_bw() We illustrate the use of the t-test by reviewing the t-statistics for each parameter in the initial model specification (Table 5-2). Both the travel cost and travel time parameters have large absolute t-statistic values (20.6 and 16.6, respectively) which lead us to reject the hypothesis that these variables have no effect on modal utilities at a confidence level higher than 99.9%. Thus, these variables should be retained in the model. All of the other t-statistics, except for Income-Shared Ride 2, Income-Shared Ride 3+ and the walk constant are greater than 1.960 (95% confidence) supporting the inclusion of the corresponding variables. The t-statistics on the shared ride specific income variables are even less than 1.645 in absolute value (90% confidence), suggesting that the effect of income on the utilities of the shared ride modes may not differentiate them from the reference (drive alone) mode. Consequently, the analyst should consider removing these income variables from the utility function specifications for the shared ride modes. The case is particularly compelling for removal of the income shared ride 3+ variable since the t-statistic is very low and the parameter has a counter-intuitive sign. Another alternative would be to combine the two shared ride income parameters suggesting that income has differential effect between drive alone and shared ride but not between shared ride 2 and shared ride 3+ (when this is done, the combined variable obtains a small negative parameter which is not statistically different from zero). This variable could be deleted or retained according to the judgment of the analyst as described in Section 6.2.1. An alternative approach is to report the t-statistic to two or three decimal places and calculate the probability that a t-statistic value of that magnitude or higher would occur due to random variation in sampling as shown in Table 5-4. This is reported as the significance level, which is the complement of the level of confidence. The significance of each parameter can be read directly from the table. Parameters with significance greater than 0.05 (lower in magnitude but more significant), provide a stronger basis for rejecting the hypothesis that the true parameter is zero and that the corresponding variable can be excluded from the model. On the other hand, significance levels of 0.163 (for Income-SR2), 0.888 (for Income-SR3+) and 0.287 (for ASC-Walk) provide little evidence about whether the corresponding variable should or should not be included in the model.22 Model 1 (Intercept) × Share ride 2 -2.178*** (-20.815) (Intercept) × Share ride 3++ -3.725*** (-20.964) (Intercept) × Transit -0.671*** (-5.060) (Intercept) × Bike -2.376*** (-7.804) (Intercept) × Walk -0.207 (-1.066) cost -0.005*** (-20.597) tvtt -0.051*** (-16.565) hhinc × Share ride 2 -0.002 (-1.397) hhinc × Share ride 3++ 0.000 (0.141) hhinc × Transit -0.005*** (-2.891) hhinc × Bike -0.013** (-2.406) hhinc × Walk -0.010*** (-3.194) Num.Obs. 5029 AIC 7276.4 BIC Log.Lik. -3626.186 rho2 0.253 rho20 0.598 Note: The numbers in the parentheses are the t-statistics * p &lt; 0.1, ** p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.01 It is important to recognize that a low t-statistic does not require removal of the corresponding variable from the model. If the analyst has a strong reason to believe that the variable is important, and the parameter sign is correct, it is reasonable to retain the variable in the model. A low t-statistic and corresponding low level of significance can best be interpreted as providing little or no information rather than as a basis for excluding a variable. Also, one should be cautious about prematurely deleting variables which are expected to be important as the same variable may be significant when other variables are added to or deleted from the model. The lack of significance of the alternative specific walk constant is immaterial since the constants represent the average effect of all the variables not included in the model and should always be retained despite the fact that they do not have a well-understood behavioral interpretation. 5.7.3.2 Test of Linear Relationship between Parameters It is often interesting to determine if two parameters are statistically different from one another or if two parameters are related by a specific value ration. These tests are similarly based on the t-statistic; however, the formulation of the test is somewhat different from that described in Section 5.7.3.1. To test the hypothesis \\(H_{0}:\\beta_{k} = \\beta_{l}\\) vs. \\(H_{A}:\\beta_{k} \\ne \\beta_{l}\\); we use the asymptotic t-statistic, which takes the following form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle t-statistic = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_{k}}-\\hat\\beta_{l}}{\\sqrt{S_{k}^{2}+S_{l}^{2}-2S_{k,l}}} (\\#eq:asymptotic H0vsHA) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\hat{\\beta_{k}}\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta_{l}}\\) are the estimates for the \\(k^{th}\\) and \\(l^{th}\\) parameters, \\(S_{k}\\), \\(S_{l}\\) are the standard errors of the estimates for the \\(k^{th}\\) and \\(l^{th}\\) parameters and \\(S_{k,l}\\) is the error covariance for the estimates for the \\(k^{th}\\) and \\(l^{th}\\) parameters. That is the ratio is the differences between the two parameter estimates and the standard deviation of that difference. As before, sufficiently large absolute values of the t-statistic lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis that the parameters are equal. Again, rejection of this null hypothesis implies that the two corresponding variables have a significant different impact on the modal utilities and suggests that the variable should be retained in the model and low absolute values of the t-statistic imply that the variables do not have significantly different effects on the utility function or the explanatory power of the model and can be combined in the model. This test can be readily extended to the test of a hypothesis that the two parameters are related by a predefined ratio; for example, the parameter for time and cost may be related by an a priori value of time. In that case, the null hypothesis becomes \\(H_{0}:\\beta_{cost} = (VOT) \\times \\beta_{time}\\) and the alternative hypothesis is \\(H_{A}:\\beta_{cost} \\ne (VOT) \\times \\beta_{time}\\). The corresponding t-statistic becomes \\[\\begin{equation} $\\displaystyle t-statistic = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{cost}-(VOT)\\hat\\beta_{time}}{\\sqrt{S_{cost}^{2}+(VOT)^{2}S_{time}^{2}-2(VOT)S_{time,cost}}}$ (\\#eq:corresponding t-statistic) \\end{equation}\\] The interpretation is the same as above except that the hypothesis refers to the equality of one parameter to the other parameter times an a priori fixed value. In this case, if it is concluded that the hypothesis is not rejected, the ratio constraint can be incorporated in the model by creating a new variable \\(X_{time,\\ cost} = X_{cost}+(VOT)X_{time}\\). 5.7.3.3 Tests of Entire Models The t-statistic is used to test the hypothesis that a single parameter is equal to some pre-selected value or that there is a linear relationship between a pair of parameters. Sometimes, we wish to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously. This is done by formulating a test statistic which can be used to compare two models provided that one is a restricted version of the other; that is, the restricted model can be obtained by imposing restrictions (setting some parameters to zero, setting pairs of parameters equal to one another and so on) on parameters in the unrestricted model. This test statistic can then be used for any case when one or more restrictions are imposed on a model to obtain another model. If all the restrictions that distinguish between the restricted and unrestricted models are valid, one would expect the difference in log-likelihood values (at convergence) of the restricted and unrestricted models to be small. If some or all the restrictions are invalid, the difference in log-likelihood values of the restricted and unrestricted models will be “sufficiently” large to reject the hypotheses. This underlying logic is the basis for the likelihood ratio test. The test statistic is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle -2\\times[LL_{R}-LL_{U}] \\tag{5.13} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(LL_{R}\\) is the log-likelihood of the restricted model, and \\(LL_{U}\\) is the log-likelihood of the unrestricted model. This test-statistic is chi-squared distributed. Example chi-squared distributions are shown in Figure 5.4. As with the test for individual parameters, the critical value for determining if the statistic is “sufficiently large” to reject the null hypothesis depends on the level of confidence desired by the model developer. It is also influenced by the number of restrictions23 between the models. Table 5-5 shows the chi-squared values for selected confidence levels and for different numbers of restrictions. Figure 5.5 illustrates the 90% and 95% confidence thresholds on the chi-squared distribution for five degrees of freedom. The critical chi-square values increase with the desired confidence level and the number of restrictions. these_colors = wesanderson::wes_palette(&quot;Darjeeling1&quot;) tibble( x = seq(0, 30, 0.01), `5` = dchisq(x, 5), `10` = dchisq(x, 10), `15` = dchisq(x, 15), ) %&gt;% gather(&quot;Degrees of Freedom&quot;, &quot;Chi-Squared&quot;, -x) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = `Chi-Squared`, color = `Degrees of Freedom`)) + geom_line() + scale_color_manual(values = these_colors) + theme_bw() Figure 5.2: Chi-Squared Distribution for 5, 10, and 15 Degrees of Freedom ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 20)), aes(x = x)) + stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = 5)) + labs( x = &quot;Test Values&quot;, y = &quot;PDF&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 5.3: Chi-Squared Distribution for 5 Degrees of Freedom Showing 90% and 95% confidence Thresholds Table 5.6: Critical Chi-Squared (\\(\\chi^2\\)) Values for Selected Confidence Levels by Number of Restrictions Number of Restrictions Level.of.Conf.

Table 5-6 illustrates the tests of two hypotheses describing restriction on some or all the parameters in the San Francisco Bay Area commuter mode choice model. The first hypothesis is that all the parameters are equal to zero. The formal statement of the null hypothesis in this case, is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle H_{0,a}:\\beta_{Travel\\ Time} = \\beta_{Travel\\ Cost} = 0, \\\\ \\beta_{SR2} = \\beta_{SR3} = \\beta_{TR} = \\beta_{WK} = \\beta_{BK} = 0, and \\\\ \\beta_{Income-SR2} = \\beta_{Income-SR3} = \\beta_{Income-Transit} = \\beta_{Income-Bike} = \\beta_{Income-Walk} = 0 \\tag{5.14} \\end{equation}\\] This test is not very useful because we almost always reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero. A somewhat more useful null hypothesis is that the variables in the initial model specification provide no additional information in addition to the market share information represented by the alternative specific constants. The restrictions for this null hypothesis are: \\[\\begin{equation} \\displaystyle H_{0,b}:\\beta_{Travel\\ Time} = \\beta_{Travel\\ Cost} = 0, and \\\\ \\beta_{Income-SR2} = \\beta_{Income-SR3+} = \\beta_{Income-Transit}, and \\\\ \\beta_{Income-Bike} = \\beta_{Income-Walk} = 0 \\tag{5.15} \\end{equation}\\] The log-likelihood values needed to test each of these hypotheses are reported in Table 5.4. In each case, we include the log-likelihood of the restricted and unrestricted models, the calculated chi-square value and the number of restrictions or degrees of freedom as shown in Table 5-6. The confidence or significance of the rejection of the null hypothesis in each case can be obtained by referring to Table 5-5, more extensive published tables or software (most spreadsheet programs) that calculates the precise level of confidence/significance associated with each test result.

These cases are not very interesting since the real value of the likelihood ratio test is in testing null hypotheses which are not so extreme. The log-likelihood ratio test can be applied to test null hypotheses involving the exclusion of selected groups of variables from the model. We consider two such hypotheses. The first is that the time and cost variables have no impact on the mode choice decision, that is, \\(H_{0,C} : \\beta_{Travel Time} = \\beta_{Travel Cost} = 0\\) The second is that income has no effect on the travel mode choice; that is \\(H_{0,D} : \\beta_{Income-SR2} = \\beta_{Income-SR3+} = \\beta_{Income-Transit} = \\beta_{Income-Bike} = \\beta_{Income-Walk} = 0\\) The restricted models that reflect each of these hypotheses and the corresponding unrestricted model are reported in Table 5-7 along with their log-likelihood values. sf_mlogit_basemodels &lt;- sf_mlogit base_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ tvtt + cost| hhinc, data = sf_mlogit_basemodels) incomebase_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ 1 | hhinc, data = sf_mlogit_basemodels) timecostbase_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ tvtt + cost, data = sf_mlogit_basemodels) base_estimation &lt;- list( &quot;Base Model&quot; = base_model, &quot;Base Model without Time and Cost Variables&quot; = incomebase_model, &quot;Base Model without Income Variables&quot; = timecostbase_model ) modelsummary( base_estimation, fmt = &quot;%.4f&quot;, title = &quot;Estimation Results for Base Model and its Restricted Versions&quot; ) (#tab:base_models table 5-7)Estimation Results for Base Model and its Restricted Versions Base Model Base Model without Time and Cost Variables Base Model without Income Variables (Intercept) × Share ride 2 -2.1780 -2.1098 -2.3083 (0.1046) (0.0993) (0.0547) (Intercept) × Share ride 3++ -3.7251 -3.4722 -3.7024 (0.1777) (0.1656) (0.0929) (Intercept) × Transit -0.6709 -1.8198 -0.9739 (0.1326) (0.1023) (0.0885) (Intercept) × Bike -2.3763 -2.6721 -3.0705 (0.3045) (0.3028) (0.1539) (Intercept) × Walk -0.2068 -1.5985 -0.7040 (0.1941) (0.1636) (0.1293) tvtt -0.0513 -0.0514 (0.0031) (0.0031) cost -0.0049 -0.0049 (0.0002) (0.0002) hhinc × Share ride 2 -0.0022 -0.0004 (0.0016) (0.0015) hhinc × Share ride 3++ 0.0004 0.0030 (0.0025) (0.0024) hhinc × Transit -0.0053 -0.0022 (0.0018) (0.0016) hhinc × Bike -0.0128 -0.0122 (0.0053) (0.0054) hhinc × Walk -0.0097 -0.0089 (0.0030) (0.0030) Num.Obs. 5029 5029 5029 AIC 7276.4 8267.2 7289.2 BIC Log.Lik. -3626.186 -4123.615 -3637.579 rho2 0.2534 0.1510 0.2511 rho20 0.5976 0.5424 0.5963 #This code recreates table 5-7 in the text with the correct coefficients and log likelihood #However, the output does not have the correct rho-square values, and is missing a number of separate statistics The statistical test of the hypothesis that time and cost have no effect has a chi-square value of \\[\\begin{equation} \\chi^2 = -2(-4123.6-(-3626.2))=994.8 \\tag{5.16} \\end{equation}\\] with two degrees of freedom (two parameters constrained to zero). The critical \\(\\chi^2\\) with two degrees of freedom at 99.9% confidence (or 0.001 level of significance) is 13.82.

The critical \\(\\chi^2\\) with five degrees of freedom at 99.9% confidence level (or 0.001 level of significance) is 20.51. Thus, both null hypotheses can be rejected at very high levels; that is, neither time and cost nor the income variables should be excluded from the model. The log-likelihood ratio tests for both the above hypotheses are summarized in Table 5-8. tibble( Hypothesis = c(&quot;$H_{0c}$&quot;,&quot;$H_{0d}$&quot;), LL_U = rep(base_model$logLik, 2), LL_R = c(incomebase_model$logLik, timecostbase_model$logLik) ) %&gt;% mutate( test_stat = -2 * (LL_R - LL_U), df = c(2, 5), &quot;Crtical Chi-Squared at 99.9% Conf.&quot; = qchisq(0.999, df), &quot;P-value&quot; = pchisq(test_stat, df, lower.tail = FALSE) ) %&gt;% kbl(align = &#39;c&#39;, caption = &quot;Likelihood Ratio Test for Hypothesis $H_{0,c}$ and $H_{0,d}$&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() Table 5.8: Likelihood Ratio Test for Hypothesis \\(H_{0,c}\\) and \\(H_{0,d}\\) Hypothesis LL_U LL_R test_stat df Crtical Chi-Squared at 99.9% Conf.

Such cases are referred to as nested hypothesis tests. However, there are important cases when the rival models do not have this type of restricted – unrestricted relationship. For example, we might like to compare the base model to an alternative specification in which the variable cost divided by income is used to replace cost. This reflects the expectation that the importance of cost diminishes with increasing income. This analysis can be performed by using the non-nested hypothesis test proposed by (J. L. Horowitz and Lerman (1986), 1982). The non-nested hypothesis test uses the adjusted likelihood ratio index, \\(\\overline{\\rho}^2\\), to test the hypothesis that the model with the lower \\(\\overline{\\rho}^2\\) value is the true model.24 In this test, the null hypothesis that the model with the lower value is the true model is rejected at the significance level determined by the following equation:25 \\[\\begin{equation} Significance Level = \\Phi \\left[-{(2(\\overline{\\rho}^2_H-\\overline{\\rho}^2_L) \\times LL(0) + (K_H - K_L))}^{1/2}\\right] \\tag{5.18} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\overline{\\rho}^2_L\\) is the adjusted likelihood ratio index for the model with the lower value, \\(\\overline{\\rho}^2_H\\) is the adjusted likelihood ratio index for the model with the higher value \\(K_H\\),\\(K_L\\) are the numbers of parameters in models H and L, respectively, and \\(\\Phi\\) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. We illustrate the non-nested hypothesis test by applying it to compare the base model with alternative specifications that replace the cost variable with cost divided by income or cost divided by ln(income). The estimation results for all three models are presented in Table 5-9. Since the model using cost not adjusted for income has the best goodness of fit (highest \\(\\overline{\\rho}^2\\)), the null hypotheses for these tests is that the model with cost by income variable or the model with cost by ln(income) is the true model. higher \\(\\overline{\\rho}^2\\). Since all the models have the same number of parameters, the term (K_H-K_L) drops out, and the equation for the test of the cost by income model being true is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Phi \\left[\\left(-{(2(\\overline{\\rho}^2_H-\\overline{\\rho}^2_L) \\times LL(0) )}^{1/2}\\right)\\right] &amp;= \\Phi \\left[-{(-2(0.5023-0.4897)(-7309.6))}^{1/2}\\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\Phi [-13.58] \\ll 0.001 \\tag{5.19} \\end{align*}\\] The corresponding test for the cost by ln(income) being true is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Phi \\left[\\left(-{(2(\\overline{\\rho}^2_H-\\overline{\\rho}^2_L) \\times LL(0) )}^{1/2}\\right)\\right] &amp;= \\Phi \\left[-{(-2(0.5023-05015)(-7309.6))}^{1/2}\\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\Phi [-3.420] &lt; 0.001 \\tag{5.20} \\end{align*}\\] The above result implies that the null hypotheses that the models with cost by income variable or cost by ln(income) are true are rejected at a significance level greater than 0.001. However, the significance of rejection is much lower for the cost by ln(income) model and many analysts would adopt that specification on the grounds that it is conceptually more appropriate. This specification suggests that the value of money declines with income but the rate of decline diminishes at higher levels of income. sf_mlogit_costinc &lt;- sf_mlogit %&gt;% mutate( costbyinc = cost / hhinc, costbylninc = cost / log(hhinc) ) base_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ tvtt + cost | hhinc, data = sf_mlogit_costinc) income_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ tvtt + costbyinc | hhinc, data = sf_mlogit_costinc) lnincome_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ tvtt + costbylninc | hhinc, data = sf_mlogit_costinc) income_estimation &lt;- list( &quot;Base Model&quot; = base_model, &quot;Model With Cost By Cost/Income&quot; = income_model, &quot;Model With Cost By ln(Income)&quot; = lnincome_model ) gm &lt;- modelsummary::gof_map gm$omit &lt;- TRUE modelsummary( income_estimation, title = &quot;Models with Cost vs. Cost/Income and Cost/Ln(Income)&quot; ) (#tab:cost_models)Models with Cost vs. Cost/Income and Cost/Ln(Income) Base Model Model With Cost By Cost/Income Model With Cost By ln(Income) (Intercept) × Share ride 2 -2.178 -2.377 -2.282 (0.105) (0.106) (0.105) (Intercept) × Share ride 3++ -3.725 -4.080 -3.906 (0.178) (0.175) (0.177) (Intercept) × Transit -0.671 -0.758 -0.731 (0.133) (0.132) (0.133) (Intercept) × Bike -2.376 -2.771 -2.556 (0.305) (0.296) (0.301) (Intercept) × Walk -0.207 -0.598 -0.369 (0.194) (0.195) (0.194) tvtt -0.051 -0.051 -0.051 (0.003) (0.003) (0.003) cost -0.005 (0.000) hhinc × Share ride 2 -0.002 0.003 0.000 (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) hhinc × Share ride 3++ 0.000 0.010 0.003 (0.003) (0.002) (0.002) hhinc × Transit -0.005 -0.001 -0.004 (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) hhinc × Bike -0.013 -0.004 -0.010 (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) hhinc × Walk -0.010 -0.002 -0.007 (0.003) (0.003) (0.003) costbyinc -0.169 (0.010) costbylninc -0.019 (0.001) Num.Obs. 5029 5029 5029 AIC 7276.4 7460.8 7282.0 BIC Log.Lik. -3626.186 -3718.390 -3629.000 rho2 0.253 0.234 0.253 rho20 0.598 0.587 0.597 5.8 Value of Time 5.8.1 Value of Time for Linear Utility Function The value of time, as described in Section 5.7.1.3, is calculated as the ratio of the parameter for time over the parameter for cost. This ratio assumes that the utility function is linear in both time and cost and that neither value is interacted with any other variables. That is, when the time and cost portion of the utility function is \\[\\begin{equation} V_i = ... + \\beta_{TVT}TVT_i + \\beta_{Cost}Cost_i + ... \\tag{5.21} \\end{equation}\\] the value of time is given by \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\beta_{TVT} \\Huge/ \\normalsize \\beta_{Cost} \\tag{5.22} \\end{equation}\\] The units of time value are obtained from the units of the variables used to measure time and cost. In the Base Model in Table 5.9, the units are minutes and cents. Thus the value of time in cents per minute implied by this model is -0.0513/-0.0049 = 10.5 cents per minute. This can be modified to $ per hour by multiply by 0.6 = (1/100 $ per cent)/(1/60 hour per minute). However, in general, the value of time is equal to the ratio between the derivative of utility with respect to time and the derivative of utility with respect to cost. That is \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\frac{\\partial{V_i}}{\\partial{Time_i}} \\Huge/ \\normalsize \\frac{\\partial{V_i}}{\\partial{Cost_i}} \\tag{5.23} \\end{equation}\\] In the case described in Equation 5.24, this produces the ratio in Equation 5.25. However, this more general formulation allows us to infer the value of time for a variety of special cases in addition to the linear utility case described above. 5.8.2 Value of Time when Cost is Interacted with another Variable This approach can be applied to any case including when either time or cost is interacted with another variable, usually a variable describing the decision maker or the decision context. For example, if cost is divided by income26 as in the second model reported in Table 5-9, on the basis that a unit of cost is proportionally less important with increasing income, the utility expression becomes \\[\\begin{equation} V_{it} = ... + \\beta_{TVT}TVT_{it} + \\beta_{CostInc}\\frac{Cost_{it}}{Income_t} + ... \\tag{5.24} \\end{equation}\\] and the value of time becomes \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\frac{\\partial{V_i}}{\\partial{Time_i}} \\Huge/ \\normalsize {\\frac{\\partial{V_i}}{\\partial{Cost_i}}} = {\\beta_{TVT}} \\Huge/ \\normalsize {\\beta_{CostInc}} \\Huge/ \\normalsize {Income_i} \\tag{5.25} \\end{equation}\\] which can be converted to \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\frac{\\frac{\\beta_{TVT}}{\\beta_{Cost}}}{Income($1000/year)}{cents/minute} \\tag{5.26} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\frac{0.6 \\times \\frac{\\beta_{TVT}}{\\beta_{Cost}}}{Income($1000/year)}{$/hour} \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, the value of time for the third specification in Table 5-9 is \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\frac{0.6 \\times \\frac{\\beta_{TVT}}{\\beta_{Cost}}}{ln[Income($1000/year)]}{$/hour} \\end{equation}\\] The value of time implied by each of these formulations is illustrated in Table 5-10 and Figure 5.6 by showing the values of time for different income levels. In each case, the values of travel time appear to be quite low. This will be addressed in model specification refinement (Section 6.2.6). tibble( AnnualIncome = c(25000, 50000, 75000, 100000, 125000)) %&gt;% mutate(HourlyWage= AnnualIncome/2000) %&gt;% mutate(linear = c(6.26, 6.26, 6.26, 6.26, 6.26)) %&gt;% mutate(CostIncome = c(4.53, 9.07, 13.60, 18.13, 21.94)) %&gt;% mutate(CostLn = c(5.18, 6.29, 6.95, 7.41, 7.72)) %&gt;% knitr::kable( caption = &quot;Value of Time vs. Income&quot;, col.names = c(&quot;Annual Income&quot;, &quot;Hourly Wage&quot;, &quot;Linear&quot;, &quot;Cost/Income&quot;, &quot;Cost/LN(Inc.)&quot;)) Table 5.9: Value of Time vs. Income Annual Income Hourly Wage Linear Cost/Income Cost/LN(Inc.) 25000 12.5 6.26 4.53 5.18 50000 25.0 6.26 9.07 6.29 75000 37.5 6.26 13.60 6.95 100000 50.0 6.26 18.13 7.41 125000 62.5 6.26 21.94 7.72 Another approach that can be used in this case is to relate the value of travel directly to the wage rate by assuming that the working year consists of 2000 hours or 120,000 minutes and recognizing that $1000 dollars is equivalent to 100,000 cents. This gives us \\[\\begin{equation} Units_{VofT} = cents \\Huge/ \\normalsize minute \\Huge/ \\normalsize $1000 \\Huge/ \\normalsize year \\tag{5.27} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} = cents \\Huge/ \\normalsize minute \\Huge/ \\normalsize 100,000~cents \\Huge/ \\normalsize 120,000~minutes \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} = 1.2 \\end{equation}\\] That is, there are no units but a simple factor of 1.2. This is interpreted as the value by which the ratio of the parameters should be multiplied to get the value of travel time as a fraction of the wage rate. In the cost by income model in Table 5-9 Models with Cost vs. Cost/Income and Cost/Ln(Income), this becomes \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\beta_{TVT} \\Huge/ \\normalsize \\beta_{CostInc} \\times 1.2 = \\frac{-0.0512}{-0.1692} \\times 1.2 = 0.363~Wage~Rate \\tag{5.28} \\end{equation}\\] which, as before, is quite low. However, as shown in Figure 5.6 and discussed in Section 5.7.3.4, this specification and the related specification for cost by ln(income) have the advantage that the value of time is differentiated across households with different income. 5.8.3 Value of Time for Time or Cost Transformation If time or cost is transformed, it becomes necessary to explicitly take the derivative of utility with respect to both time and cost. For example, if time enters the utility function using the natural log transformation, to suggest that the utility effect of increasing time decreases with time, the utility function becomes \\[\\begin{equation} V_{it} = ... + \\beta_{ln(TVT)}ln(TVT_{it}) + \\beta_{Cost}Cost_{it} + ... \\tag{5.29} \\end{equation}\\] and the value of time becomes \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\frac{\\partial{V_{it}}}{\\partial{Time_{it}}} \\Huge/ \\normalsize \\frac{\\partial{V_{it}}}{\\partial{Cost_{it}}} = \\beta_{ln(TVT)} \\Huge/ \\normalsize TVT_{it} \\Huge/ \\normalsize \\beta_{Cost} = \\frac{\\beta_{ln(TVT)}}{\\beta_{Cost}} \\times \\frac{1}{TVT_{it}} \\tag{5.30} \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, if cost is entered as the natural log of cost, the value of time becomes \\[\\begin{equation} VofT = \\frac{\\partial{V_{it}}}{\\partial{Time_{it}}} \\Huge/ \\normalsize \\frac{\\partial{V_{it}}}{\\partial{Cost_{it}}} = \\beta_{TVT} \\Huge/ \\normalsize \\beta_{ln(Cost)} \\Huge/ \\normalsize Cost_{it} = \\frac{\\beta_{TVT}}{\\beta_{ln(Cost)}} \\times Cost_{it} \\tag{5.31} \\end{equation}\\] which can be reported in a table for selected values of time or plotted in a graph of Value of Time as a function of TVT or Cost, as appropriate (see below). Models using each of these formulations are estimated and reported, along with the Base Model in Table 5-11. The goodness of fit is substantially improved by using ln(time), which is generally expected, but is worse when using ln(cost), for which there is no conceptual basis. base_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ tvtt + cost | hhinc, data = sf_mlogit) lntravaltime_model &lt;- mlogit(chosen ~ cost + log(tvtt) | hhinc, data = sf_mlogit) # lots of variables have zero cost, and log(0) = -Inf.
